<small>WHERE THE HOUSES ARE BIG</small></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;It&#8217;s</span> a queer kind of a name, though it suits
you,&#8221; observed the Gray Gentleman, thoughtfully.
&#8220;How came you by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay flashed the questioner a smile,
hugged Max closer and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born on a Sunday morning. That&#8217;s
how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed? But I don&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you? Seems easy. Let&#8217;s sit down
here by &#8216;Father George&#8217; and I&#8217;ll explain. If
I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman was very tall and dignified,
yet he had a habit of doing whatever
Bonny-Gay asked him. So he now doubled
himself up and perched on the low curb surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the monument, while the little girl and
the big black dog dropped easily down beside
him. Then he leaned his head back against the
iron railing and gazed reflectively into the face
of the big bronze lion, just opposite.</p>

<p>Both the child and the man were fond of the
wonderful lion, which seemed a mighty guardian
of the beautiful Place, and he, at least,
knew it to be a world-famous work of art.
Bonny-Gay loved it as she loved all animals,
alive or sculptured, and with much the same
devotion she gave to Max. The park without
either of these four-footed creatures would have
seemed strange indeed to her, for they were
her earliest playmates and remained still her
dearest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can tell me,&#8221; again suggested the
Gray Gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Easter, too. All the people were
going to the churches, the bells were ringing,
the organs playing, and everything just beautiful.
Nurse Nance began it, my mother says.
&#8216;For the child that is born on the Sabbath Day
is lucky, and bonny, and wise, and gay.&#8217; But
my father says there isn&#8217;t any &#8216;luck&#8217; and a
child like me isn&#8217;t &#8216;wise,&#8217; so they had to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
them out and I&#8217;m only Bonny-Gay. That&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very satisfactory explanation,&#8221; said the
Gray Gentleman, with one of his rare smiles,
and laying his hand kindly upon the golden
curls. &#8220;And now, my dear, one question more.
In which of these beautiful houses do you live?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the stranger&#8217;s glance wandered
all about that aristocratic neighborhood of Mt.
Vernon Place, to which he had returned after
many years of absence to make his own home.
Since he had gone away all the small people
whom he used to know and love had grown up,
and he had felt quite lost and lonely, even in
that familiar scene, till he had chanced to meet
Bonny-Gay, just one week before. Since then,
and her ready adoption of himself as a comrade,
he had had no time for loneliness. She was
always out in the charming Square, as much a
part of it as the Washington monument, which
the little folks called &#8220;Father George,&#8221; or the
bronzes, and the smooth lawns. She seemed
as bright as the sunshine and almost as well-beloved,
for the other children flocked about
her, the keeper consulted her and the keeper&#8217;s
dog followed her like a shadow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>With a toss of her yellow locks she pointed
her forefinger westward.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, in that corner one, all covered by
vines, with places for the windows cut out, and
the chimneys all green, and I think it&#8217;s the
prettiest one in the whole place, when it has its
summer clothes on. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman&#8217;s glance followed the
direction of the pointing finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It is a very lovely home and a very
big one. I hope you are not the only child who
lives in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hope it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would be lonely, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lonely? I? Why&mdash;why&mdash;I just never
have a single minute to myself. There&#8217;s my
thirteen dolls, and the parrot, and the two canaries,
and the aquarium, and my pony, and&mdash;Oh!
dear! you can&#8217;t guess. That&#8217;s why I have
to come out here&mdash;to rest myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so! Well, I should judge that you
spend the most of your time in &#8216;resting,&#8217;&#8221;
commented the other. &#8220;Whenever I come out
you&#8217;re always here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>Bonny-Gay laughed; so merrily that Max
lifted his head and licked her cheek. That reminded
her of something and she asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen him get his second dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even his first!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t? How odd!&#8221; Bonny-Gay
shook out her skirts and proceeded to enlighten
her comrade&#8217;s ignorance. She took it for
granted, or she had done so, that he knew as
much about things as she herself; but if not,
why, there was a deal to tell. Max&#8217;s history
first. She began by declaring:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the smartest dog in the world. Everybody
knows that. He&#8217;s lived in the Place
nine years. That&#8217;s one year longer than I have.
All the children&#8217;s big brothers and sisters have
played with him, same&#8217;s we do now. He never
lets a tramp come near. He never steps on a
flower bed or lets us. If we forget and go on
the grass he barks us off. He gets his first dinner
at our house. When the clocks strike
twelve he goes to the gardener and gets his
basket. Then he walks to our back entrance,
puts the basket down, stands up on his hind
feet and pushes his nose against the &#8217;lectric
bell. That rings up the cook and&mdash;she&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
man just now&mdash;he&mdash;she takes the basket and
puts in some food. Then Max walks down that
side street, about a square, and sits on the curb
to eat it. &#8216;Just like a beggar,&#8217; the gardener
says, &#8216;&#8217;cause he likes to feed his own dog his
own self.&#8217; I would, too, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I owned the &#8216;smartest dog in the whole
world&#8217; I presume I should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Max feels ashamed of it, too; don&#8217;t you,
dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dog replied by dropping his black head
from Bonny-Gay&#8217;s shoulder to the ground and
by blinking in a deprecating way from that
lowly position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, in a few minutes, he comes back to
the gardener with the empty basket and stands
and wags his tail as if he were the hungriest
dog that ever was. Then the keeper says:
&#8216;Yes. You may go, Max!&#8217; And off he trots,
away down the other way, to some place where
his master lives and gets a second basket full.
That he brings back here, and the man puts a
paper on the ground under the bushes and he
eats again. Just like folks to their own table,
that time; don&#8217;t you, Max Doggie, smart
doggie!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>The handsome animal shook his wavy fleece
and sprang up, ready for a frolic and evidently
aware that he had been the subject of
discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not yet, sir. The best thing hasn&#8217;t been
told. Listen, please, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger waited a moment, then inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. what, Bonny-Gay? I wonder if you
know my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not your truly one, but that doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you happen to call me, if you ever
speak of me when I&#8217;m not here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl hesitated an instant, then
frankly answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, just the &#8216;Gray Gentleman.&#8217; &#8217;Cause
you are all gray, you see. Your hair, and your
moustache, and your eyes, and your clothes,
and your hat, and your gloves, and&mdash;and&mdash;things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Trust a child to find an appropriate
nickname. But I like it, little
one. Go on, about Max and the best thing
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That splendid dog has&mdash;saved&mdash;his&mdash;master&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
life! As true as true!&#8221; cried Bonny-Gay,
impressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! Wonderful! How was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was pay-day night and Mr. Weems,
that&#8217;s his name, had a lot of money. And some
bad men knew it. And they came, do you believe,
right in the middle of that night, and
broke a window in Mr. Weems&#8217;s house; and
Max heard them and flew&mdash;and flew&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman stooped and searched
for the dog&#8217;s wings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ran, then,&#8221; laughed Bonny-Gay,
&#8220;and he drove them all off and they had revolvers
or something and one was shot and a
policeman caught him and Max was shot and
the gardener would have been killed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only he wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; interrupted somebody,
coming from behind them.</p>

<p>So the child paused in her breathless description
of a scene she had often pictured to herself
and looked up into the face of the hero of the
affair, himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Weems! you almost frightened
me! and you please tell the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>But though the gardener smiled upon her he
nodded his head gravely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;Guess it won&#8217;t do for me to think about
that just now, or any other of our good times,
old Max! Good fellow, fine fellow! Poor old
doggie! It&#8217;s going to be as hard on you as on
me, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Bonny-Gay saw that something
was amiss. She half fancied that there were
tears in the keeper&#8217;s eyes, and she always afterward
declared that there were tears in his voice.
As for Max, that sagacious animal sank suddenly
upon his haunches, looked sternly into
his master&#8217;s face, and demanded by his earnest,
startled expression to know what was wrong.
Something was. He knew that, even more
positively than did Bonny-Gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an outrageous law. There ought to be
exceptions to it. All dogs&mdash;Well, there&#8217;s no
other dog like Max. Ah! hum. Old doggie!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman was tempted to ask
questions, but the little girl was sure to do that;
so he waited. In a few minutes she had gotten
the whole sad story from her old friend, the
gardener, and her sunny head had gone down
upon the dog&#8217;s black one in a paroxysm of
grief.</p>

<p>A moment later it was lifted defiantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;But he shan&#8217;t. He shall not! Nobody
shall ever, ever take our Max away! Why&mdash;why&mdash;it
wouldn&#8217;t be the Place without him!
Why&mdash;why&mdash;the children&mdash;Oh! Nettie! oh!
Tom!&#8221; and catching sight of a group of playmates
Bonny-Gay darted toward them, calling
as she ran: &#8220;They&#8217;re going to take him away!
They&#8217;re going to take him away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom planted his feet wide apart upon the
smooth path and obstructed her advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take who away, Bonny-Gay? Where to?
When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Max! Our Max! He can never come here
any more. This is his last day in our park&mdash;his
very last!&#8221; and the child flung herself headlong
upon the shaven grass, for once regardless
of rules.</p>

<p>Not so regardless was Max, the trusty. It
didn&#8217;t matter to him that this was Bonny-Gay,
his best-loved playmate, or that her frantic sorrow
was all on his account. What he saw was
his duty and he did it, instantly. From a distance
the Gray Gentleman watched the dog
race toward the prostrate little girl and shake
her short skirts vigorously, loosing them now
and then to bark at her with equal vigor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Presently she sprang up and to the footpath,
and again indulged in a wild embrace of the
faithful canine. Indeed, he was at once the
center of an ever-increasing company of small
people, who seemed to vie with each other in
attempts to hug his breath away and to outdo
everybody in the way of fierce indignation.
Finally, this assembly resolved itself into an advancing
army, and with Tom and Bonny-Gay
as leaders&mdash;each tightly holding to one of the
dog&#8217;s soft ears, as they marched him between
them&mdash;they returned to the spot where the lion
calmly awaited them, and Tom announced their
decision:</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t ever let him go. There&#8217;s no
need for you nor the law-men nor nobody to interfere.
This dog belongs to this park; and
this park belongs to us children; and if anybody
tries to&mdash;tries to&mdash;to&mdash;do&mdash;things&mdash;he
won&#8217;t never be let! So there! And if he is,
we&#8217;ll&mdash;we&#8217;ll augernize; and we&#8217;ll get every boy
and girl in all the streets around to come, too;
and we&#8217;ll all go march to where the law-men
live; and we won&#8217;t never, never leave go talking
at them till they take it all back. &#8217;Cause
Max isn&#8217;t going to be took. That&#8217;s the fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Mr. Weems, and you can just tell them
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Nettie, &#8220;and my big brother
goes to the law school and he&#8217;ll suesan them.
And my big sister&#8217;s friends will help; and if
he does have to, I&#8217;ll never, never&mdash;NEVER&mdash;play
in this hateful old park ever again. I will
not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled the Gray Gentleman,
softly. &#8220;This looks serious. A children&#8217;s
crusade, indeed. Well, that should be irresistible.&#8221;
And this old lover of all little people
looked admiringly over the group of flushed
and indignant faces; and at the noble animal
which was the very center of it, and whose silent
protest was the most eloquent of all. His
own heart echoed their indignation and he
quietly resolved to make an effort on their and
Max&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p>But the dire, unspoken threats of the children,
and the silent resolution of the Gray
Gentleman, were useless. For when upon the
next morning the sun rose over the pleasant
Place, and the monument and the lion began
to cast their shadows earthward, there was
no Max to gambol at their feet, and over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
heart of Bonny-Gay had fallen her first real
grief.</p>

<p>She was out early, to see if the dreadful
thing were true; and the Gray Gentleman met
her and scarcely knew her&mdash;without the smiles.</p>

<p>When he did recognize her he said, hopefully:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll trust it&#8217;s all for the best, my dear.
Besides, you will now have more time for the
thirteen dolls, and the parrot, and the two canaries,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&mdash;they aren&#8217;t Max! He was the
only! We loved him so and now he&#8217;ll just be
wasted on strangers! Oh! it&#8217;s too bad, too
bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman clasped the little hand in
sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry for your sorrow, Bonny-Gay,
and yet I can&#8217;t believe that Max is
&#8216;wasted.&#8217; No good thing ever is. Besides that,
I have a plan in my head. With your parents&#8217;
permission, I am going to take you this day to
visit your twin sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My&mdash;twin&mdash;sister! Why there isn&#8217;t any.
Don&#8217;t you remember? I told you. I&#8217;m the
only, only one. There never was any other.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>&#8220;Nevertheless, I am obliged to contradict
you. Very rude, I know, and I shouldn&#8217;t do
so, if I were not so positive of what I claim. I
hope you&#8217;ll love her and I think you will. After
breakfast I&#8217;ll see you again. Good
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he walked briskly away and
Bonny-Gay saw him enter the big gray house
in the middle of the Place. The house where
the wooden shutters had always been up, ever
since she could remember, until just this spring,
when a few of the windows had been uncovered
to let the sunlight in.</p>

<p>&#8220;My&mdash;twin&mdash;sister! How queer that is!&#8221;
mused the watching child.</p>

<small>WHERE THE HOUSES ARE SMALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane</span> dropped her crutches on the floor
and readjusted the baby. He had a most trying
habit of not staying &#8220;put,&#8221; and sometimes
the other children slapped him. Mary
Jane never did that. She merely set him up
again, gave his cheek a pat or a kiss, and went
on about her business.</p>

<p>For, indeed, she was almost the very busiest
small body in the world. Besides her own
mother&#8217;s five other children there were the
neighbors&#8217; broods, big and little, with never a
soul to mind them save their self-constituted
nurse.</p>

<p>That very morning Mrs. Bump had paused
in her washing to look up and exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;I never did see how the little things do take
to her! She can do just wonders with them,
that she can; and I reckon it was about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
best thing ever happened to her, that falling out
the top window, like she did. Seemed to knock
all the selfishness out of her. Maybe it&#8217;s <i>that</i>
settled in her poor body. Yes, maybe it&#8217;s that,
dear heart. Anyhow, her inside&#8217;s all right.
The rightest there ever was. If this world was
just full of Mary Janes, what a grand place
it would be!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, after a regretful sigh for this beatific
state of things, the mother thrust her strong
arms again into the suds, with a splash and
a rub-a-dub-dub which told plainly enough from
whom Mary Jane inherited her energy.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Stebbins thrust her head out
of the window, next door, to remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;There was fifty-four of them gardens given
out. My boy&#8217;s goin&#8217; to raise cabbages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! Now, ain&#8217;t that fine? I
wish I had a son to get one, but all my boys is
girls, save the baby, and he don&#8217;t count.
Though he&#8217;ll grow, won&#8217;t he, mother&#8217;s lamb?
He&#8217;ll grow just as fast as he can and get a playground
garden, good&#8217;s the next one, so he will,
the precious!&#8221; chirruped Mrs. Bump, to the
year-old heir of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gah, gah!&#8221; cooed the baby; and emphasized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
his reply by losing his balance against
the wall and rolling over on his face. He was
too fat and too phlegmatic to right himself, so
Mary Jane hopped back across the narrow
room and set him up again, laughing as if this
were the funniest thing she had ever seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw, daughter! If I was you and you
was me, I&#8217;d leave him lie that way a spell. He
don&#8217;t &#8217;pear to have the sense the rest of you
had, no he don&#8217;t, the sweet! Maybe that&#8217;s because
he&#8217;s a boy. But even a boy might learn
something after a while, if he was let. Only
you&#8217;re so right on hand all the time he expects
you to just about breathe for him, seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, mother, now! And you know he&#8217;s
the biggest, roundest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pudding-headedest!&#8221; growled a masculine
voice, at the narrow doorway.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bump wheeled round so sharply that
her rubbing-board fell out of the tub and scared
the baby, who promptly began to scream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why father! You home? It can&#8217;t be dinner-time,
yet. What&#8217;s happened? Anything
wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anything ever right?&#8221; demanded the
man, sulkily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;Plenty of things,&#8221; answered the wife,
cheerfully, though her heart sank.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the right things is my getting
kicked out, I s&#8217;pose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father! you don&#8217;t mean it! No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not much of a joker, am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That you&#8217;re not. But tell me, man.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a quiver in the usually cheerful voice,
Mrs. Bump wiped the suds from her arms
and went to her husband. Laying her hand
kindly upon his shoulder she demanded, as was
her right, to know the facts of the disaster that
had befallen them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twon&#8217;t take long to tell, woman. The company&#8217;s
cuttin&#8217; down expenses and I was one of
the expenses lopped off. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all&mdash;<i>all</i>, William Bump?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was sternly put and the man
cowered before it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the truth, any way. No matter how
it happened, here I am and no work.&#8221; With
that he dropped his arms upon the window sill
and his face upon his arms, and lapsed into a
sullen silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bump caught her breath, whisked
away a tear that had crept into her eye, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
returned to her tub. Mary Jane ceased staring
at her parents, tipped the baby&#8217;s home-made
go-cart on end, rolled him into it, righted the
awkward vehicle, threw its leather strap over
her shoulders, called to the children: &#8220;Come!&#8221;
and hopped away upon her crutches.</p>

<p>Though she paused, for just one second, beside
her father and imprinted a hasty kiss upon
the back of his bent head. A kiss so light it
seemed he could scarcely have felt it, though it
was quite sufficient to thrill the man&#8217;s soul with
an added sense of regret and degradation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off to the park, mother, and I&#8217;ve
taken a loaf with me!&#8221; she called backward,
as she clicked out of sight.</p>

<p>Again the woman idled for a moment, looking
through the open doorway toward the
small, misshapen figure of her eldest child as
it swung swiftly forward upon its &#8220;wooden
feet.&#8221; The baby&#8217;s soap-box wagon rattled and
bumped along behind, bouncing his plump body
about, and drawn by Mary Jane in the only
manner possible to her&mdash;with a strap across her
chest. She needed both her hands just then to
support herself upon her crutches; for her
lower limbs were useless and swung heavily between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
these crutches&mdash;a leaden weight from
which she never could be free.</p>

<p>Even so, there were few who could travel as
rapidly as Mary Jane and this morning she
was especially eager to get on. Because down
at the pretty park upon which her own dingy
street terminated, the children&#8217;s &#8220;Playgrounds&#8221;
had been opened for the summer and
the small gardens given out. She was anxious
to see the planting and seed-sowing, by the tiny
farmers of this free kindergarten, and down in
her heart was a faint hope that even to her, a
girl, might a bit of land be assigned; where she,
too, could raise some of the wonderful vegetables
which would be her very own when the autumn
came and the small crops were harvested.</p>

<p>The hope was so deep and so intense, that she
had to stop, turn about, shake up the baby and
tell him about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Baby Bump, they don&#8217;t give &#8217;em
out to just girls. Only I&#8217;m not a regular plain
kind of girl, I&#8217;m a crippley sort. That might
make a difference. Though there&#8217;s Hattie
Moran, she&#8217;s lame, too. Not very lame, Baby,
only a little lame. She doesn&#8217;t have to have
crutches, she just goes hoppety-pat, hoppety-pat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
easy like. Sophia Guttmacher, she&#8217;s a
hunchback, same&#8217;s me, course, but she can
walk. Besides that she doesn&#8217;t want a garden
and I do. As for Ernest Knabe, his foot&#8217;s just
twisted and that&#8217;s all. Then, too, he&#8217;s a boy.
He could have one if he wanted. He&#8217;d have to
dig one, I guess, if it wasn&#8217;t for his foot. Oh!
Baby dear. Do you s&#8217;pose I might&mdash;I might,
maybe, get one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goo, goo,&#8221; murmured the infant, encouragingly,
and vainly trying to bring his own
foot within reach of his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you sweet! You can&#8217;t do that, you
know. You&#8217;re far too fat. And I declare, all
the other children have gone on while I&#8217;ve
stood here just talking to you. That won&#8217;t do,
sir, much as I love you. Sit up, now, there&#8217;s
sister&#8217;s little man, and I&#8217;ll hurry up.&#8221;</p>

<p>But just then, Baby made a final, desperate
effort to taste his toes, lost his balance, and
rolled forward out of his box, as a ball might
have done.</p>

<p>Mary Jane, burst into a peal of laughter
which recalled the other children to the spot
and she explained between breaths:</p>

<p>&#8220;The cute little fellow was trying to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
&#8216;huckleberry-bread&#8217;; I do believe he was, the
darling! Well, he&#8217;s so round it doesn&#8217;t matter
which way he tumbles, and he&#8217;s so soft nothing
ever hurts him. Does it, precious?&#8221;</p>

<p>They all lent a hand in setting the infant
right again. Several holding the soap-box
level, a couple supporting Mary Jane without
her crutches which left her arms free to lift and
replace the dislodged baby. When things were
once more in order the caravan started onward
afresh.</p>

<p>By this time the small, dingy houses bordering
the narrow unpaved street had given place
to open lots and weedy patches, where the sun
lay warmly and a fresh breeze blew. To the
right of the open space was a railway embankment,
and on the left there was the cling-clanging
of a mighty steel structure, in process of
building. The railway and the monster
&#8220;sheds&#8221; belonged to the same company for
which William Bump had toiled&mdash;when he felt
inclined&mdash;and by which he had just been
discharged.</p>

<p>Mary Jane had been accustomed to look for
him, either along the rails, with the gang that
seemed always to be replacing old &#8220;ties&#8221; by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
new ones; or else serving the skilled workmen,
who hammered, hammered, all day long upon
the great metal girders. As she now caught
the echo of these strokes a pang shot through
her loving heart and for a moment her sunny
face clouded. She need look no more, to either
right or left, for the blue-shirted figure, which
had been wont to wave a salutation to her as
she passed with her brood of nurselings.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the baby was on hand to banish
the cloud, which he promptly did in his accustomed
manner&mdash;with a slight variation. For
his small charioteer had not observed a big
stone in the path, though the loose ricketty
wheel of the wagon found and struck it
squarely. This raised the soap-box in front
and its occupant performed a backward somersault.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my sake! Mary Jane&mdash;Mary Jane!&#8221;
shrieked several small voices in wild reproach.</p>

<p>Mary Jane picked up the little one, who
smiled, unhurt; and the others helped her shake
him back to a normal condition and pose. After
which, the park lying just before them, between
the railway and the buildings, they scurried into
it, and over the slope, and around to a sunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
spot where scores of other little people were
hard at work or play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! Mary Jane! Oh, Mary Jane!&#8221;
shouted one and another; and the kind-faced
&#8220;teachers&#8221; who guided the wee ones, also
nodded their friendly welcome. For well they
knew that there was no &#8220;assistant&#8221; in the
whole city who could be as useful to them as this
same humble little girl from Dingy street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirteen, Mary Jane! I&#8217;m thirteen! Come
see. Cucumbers!&#8221; cried Bobby Saunders,
dragging her forward so eagerly that the soap-box
strap slipped up across her throat and
choked her. But she quickly released herself
now from her burden, certain that in the midst
of so many friends no harm could befall her
darling; and once freed from this incubus,
she outstripped Bobby in reaching the long
rows of well-prepared garden plots, wherein as
yet was never a sign of any growing thing.</p>

<p>But oh! how soft and rich and brown the
earth did look! How sweet the fragrance of it
in Mary Jane&#8217;s nature-loving nostrils! And
how, for once, she longed to be a boy! As
straight-limbed, as strong, as unhindered at her
toil, as any of these happy little lads who clustered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
about, each interrupting his neighbor in
his eagerness for her sympathy and interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty-one, Mary Jane!&#8221; cried Joe Stebbins,
pointing proudly to the numbered stick
at the foot of his plot. &#8220;Cabbages&mdash;cabbages!
The gardener&#8217;s bringing a box of plants this
minute. I&#8217;ll give you one to bile when they get
growed. Like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prime!&#8221; answered the girl, her own face
aglow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m limas, Mary Jane. I&#8217;m Seven.
Away over here. I&#8217;ve sowed &#8217;em and to-morrer
I&#8217;ll hoe &#8217;em, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I guess I wouldn&#8217;t till they sprout,&#8221;
laughed she hopping along, at perilous speed, to
inspect number seven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go so fast, Mary Jane! I can&#8217;t keep
up with you. See. I&#8217;m right up front&mdash;number
Three. I&#8217;m tomatuses, I am. Like &#8217;em?&#8221;
demanded Ned Smith, a seven-year-old farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m potatoes. They&#8217;re the best for your
money,&#8221; observed Jimmy O&#8217;Brien. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
roast some in the ashes, bime-by. Does the
baby like &#8217;tatoes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t he? You just ought to see him eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
them&mdash;when we have them,&#8221; she added, cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you&#8217;ll have &#8217;em, plenty. When I dig
my crop. Why, I s&#8217;pose there&#8217;ll be enough in
my &#8216;farm&#8217; to keep your folks and mine all winter;
and I might have some to sell on the street,&#8221;
observed Jimmy, casting a speculative glance
upon the diminutive plot of ground over which
he was now master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might you; ain&#8217;t that splendid!&#8221; commented
Mary Jane, delightedly. &#8220;Why, if you
could give us all our potatoes, mother could
easy wash for the rent and the bread and things.
My sake! I &#8217;most forgot the baby. Where&#8217;s
he at? Can you see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right in the middle of the sand-heap
and the teacher has give him a little shovel.
Say, what you bring him for? this ain&#8217;t no day-nursery,
this ain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a playground farm and
one-year-olds don&#8217;t belong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they don&#8217;t, but the baby belongs.
That is if I do,&#8221; said the sister stoutly; &#8220;maybe
you&#8217;ll say next I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I shan&#8217;t say that. Why, what could we
do without you? And say, Mary Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, say it quick. The girls are calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
me to swing on the Maypole. &#8217;Cause that&#8217;s one
thing I can do without my crutches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in a minute. But, say. Sometimes
I used to let you hoe in my garden, last summer.
Remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. I helped you a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know about that. But you might
this year. That is, maybe. If we went partners,
you see; and if the teacher didn&#8217;t get on to
it; and if there was a medal give and you let me
have it, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m the one has the farm, course.
What you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say we couldn&#8217;t do such a thing without
the teacher knowing and I wouldn&#8217;t if we could.
And you&#8217;ll never get a medal, you&#8217;re too lazy.
But you&#8217;re real gen&#8217;rous, too, and I&#8217;ll be so glad
to help. Oh! I love it! I just feel&#8217;s if I could
put my face right down on that crumbly
ground and go to sleep. It&#8217;s so dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! If you did I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;d get earwigs
in your ears and&mdash;and angleworms, and&mdash;things.
Maybe snakes. But I&#8217;ll let you,&#8221;
concluded Jimmy, graciously.</p>

<p>Then they turned around and there was&mdash;what
seemed to the beholders, a veritable small
angel!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Mary Jane was so startled she dropped her
crutches and, for an instant, quite forgot all
about the baby. The apparition was clothed in
white, so soft and fine and transparent that it
seemed to enwrap her as a cloud; and above the
cloud rose a face so lovely and so winning that
it made Mary Jane&#8217;s heart almost stand still in
ecstasy.</p>

<small>HOW THE PAIR MET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> when things cleared a little, it was only
Bonny-Gay! and the Gray Gentleman was supporting
Mary Jane without her crutches&mdash;though
she didn&#8217;t realize that, at first. Afterward
she was able to look up into his face and
smile a welcome, because he and she were already
quite close friends.</p>

<p>What had happened was this: the Gray Gentleman
had sent his elderly black &#8220;boy&#8221; with
a note to the vine-covered house in Mt. Vernon
Place and had requested &#8220;the favor of Miss
Beulah&#8217;s company upon a drive, that morning.
He intended to visit one of the &#8216;Playgrounds&#8217;
in the south-western part of the city, and he
felt that the little girl whose society he so
greatly enjoyed would find much to interest
her, if she might be with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this he had signed a name which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
quite powerful enough to secure Mrs. McClure&#8217;s
instant and delighted assent; and she
had at once returned a very graceful note of
acceptance by the &#8220;boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then at ten o&#8217;clock precisely, the Gray Gentleman&#8217;s
carriage had gone around for &#8220;Miss
McClure,&#8221; and she had been lifted into it and
to a seat beside her friend. A half-hour&#8217;s drive
followed; through streets and avenues which
Bonny-Gay had never seen before, and which
continually grew narrower and more crowded.
Even the houses seemed to shrink in size, and
the little girl had finally exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s like the buildings were so little
that they just squeeze the folks out of them,
upon the steps and through the windows. I
never, never saw! Will they get to be just
playhouses, by-and-by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Bonny-Gay, I&#8217;m sure you never did.
Yet it&#8217;s the same city in which is your own big
home, and they are just the same sort of human
beings as you and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they? It doesn&#8217;t&mdash;doesn&#8217;t just seem
so, does it? And why do they all stare at us
like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we do at them, maybe; and it&#8217;s not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
a common thing to see carriages with liveried
attendants pass this way. I suppose you, in
your dainty clothes, are as much a &#8216;show&#8217; to
them as they to you in their coarse attire, or
rags.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay looked thoughtfully at her frock.
She would have preferred to wear a simpler
one; and a comfortable &#8220;Tam&#8221; instead of the
feathered hat which adorned her sunny head.
But her mother had decided otherwise; since
the Gray Gentleman had done her the honor of
that morning it was but courtesy to show appreciation
of it by a good appearance.</p>

<p>After a moment she looked up and observed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the queerest thing! I feel as if I ought
to get out and walk; and as if I should give this
hat to that little girl who hasn&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be going to the other extreme,
my dear, and would help neither you nor them.
Besides, this is not all we came to see, and here
we are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the street had suddenly ended and the
carriage had turned in at a big gate, to roll almost
silently onward till it stopped before a
&#8220;Mansion,&#8221; with ancient wooden shutters and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
a clematis-draped porch. This was natural and
quite suggestive to Bonny-Gay of her own beloved
Druid Hill, wherein she was accustomed
to take her stately drives in her father&#8217;s own
carriage; and when she heard the shouts and
laughter of children from the tree-hidden
&#8220;Playgrounds,&#8221; her spirits rose to the normal
again and she laughed in return.</p>

<p>Dancing along beside him, with her hand in
his, she had demanded eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it here I am to see my &#8216;twin sister?&#8217;
Oh! I want to find her&mdash;quick, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is here, and this is&mdash;she;&#8221; answered
her guide, as they paused behind Jimmy and
Mary Jane, toward whom he silently nodded.</p>

<p>This was how the pair met; and while Mary
Jane saw what she fancied was an &#8220;angel&#8221;
that which Bonny-Gay saw was a girl of her
own age, with short, limp legs, very long arms,
and a crooked back. But the dark head above
the poor humped shoulders was as shapely as
the &#8220;angel&#8217;s&#8221; own; the dark eyes as beautiful
as the blue ones; and from the wide, merry
mouth flashed a smile quite as radiant and
winning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>As soon as she saw the smile Bonny-Gay began
to understand what the Gray Gentleman
had meant, and she telegraphed him a glance
that said she did. Then she laughed and held
out her two hands to Mary Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re the girl I&#8217;ve come to see:
my &#8216;twin sister!&#8217; How-de-do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How-de-do?&#8221; echoed Mary Jane, too astonished
to say more.</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman quietly slipped her
crutches under the cripple&#8217;s arms, and seizing
Jimmy&#8217;s hand walked swiftly away.</p>

<p>Both girls looked after him with regret but
he neither glanced back nor expected them to
follow. Then they regarded each other with
curiosity, till Mary Jane remembered she was
the hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down,&#8221; she said pointing to the
grass.</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay hesitated, and, seeing this, the
other whisked off her apron and spread it for
her guest. &#8220;You might spoil your dress, that&#8217;s
so. Salt and lemon juice&#8217;ll take out grass-stain.
My mother uses that when there&#8217;s spots
on the &#8216;wash.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she? I wasn&#8217;t thinking of my frock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
though, but of <i>that</i>;&#8221; answered the visitor,
pointing to a &#8220;Keep Off&#8221; sign behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that? Nobody minds that. You see,
this is <i>our</i> park now. We play where we
choose, only on the terraces and slopey places.
You&#8217;d better use my apron though, it&#8217;s such a
splendid dress. Your mother would feel bad
if you smirched it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she would. She&#8217;s very particular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;s mine. They say she&#8217;s the very neatest
woman in Dingy street. The neighbors say
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And our cook says mine is the &#8216;fussiest&#8217;
one in the Place. That might be some of the
&#8216;sister&#8217; part, mightn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might. Only, course, he&#8217;s just fooling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the Gray Gentleman ever
fools. He means things. He&#8217;s made us children
think a lot. More&#8217;n we ever did before.
And he says things mean things, too, every single
one. Even &#8216;Father George,&#8217; and the lion,
and Max, and&mdash;and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this exhausting speech Bonny-Gay removed
her hat and laid it upon the grass, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Mary Jane regarded it admiringly. It was so
pretty she would have liked to touch it, just
once. The hat&#8217;s owner saw the admiration,
and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it on, Mary Jane. See if it will fit
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I daren&#8217;t!&#8221; gasped the other. &#8220;I
might hurt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay lifted the hat and placed it upon
the cripple&#8217;s dark head, which was held perfectly
motionless, while the face beneath the
brim took on an expression of bewildered happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! ain&#8217;t it lovely! I should think you&#8217;d
want to wear it all the time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, then. I like my &#8216;Tam&#8217; better, and
nothing best of all. You can wear it as long
as I stay, if you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good of you. Some of the other girls
wouldn&#8217;t even let me touch their best hats, they
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be selfish things, then. How old
are you, Mary Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you know my name? and what&#8217;s
yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay stated it and explained:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;I heard that Jimmy boy call you. How old
did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say, but I&#8217;m eight, going on nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so am I. I&#8217;m a &#8216;Sunday&#8217;s bairn&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I!&#8221; cried Mary Jane, breathlessly.</p>

<p>After that confidences were swift; and, presently,
each little girl knew all about the other;
till, in one pause for breath, the cripple suddenly
remembered the baby. Then she caught
up her crutches, swung herself upon them, and
started off in pursuit of him.</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay watched her disappear in the
midst of the crowd of children, who had all
shyly held aloof from herself, saw how they
clung about her and how some of the tiniest
ones held up their faces to be kissed. She saw
her stoop to tie the ragged shoe of one and
button the frock of another; saw her pause to
listen to the complaint of a sobbing lad and
smartly box the ears of his tormentor. Then
another glimmering of the Gray Gentleman&#8217;s
meaning, when he called these two &#8220;sisters,&#8221;
came into Bonny-Gay&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has to take care of the children down
here just as I do in our park. I suppose we
two are the only ones have time to bother, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
how can she do it! Her face is so pretty&mdash;prettier,
even, than Nettie&#8217;s, but I dare not look
at the rest of her. I just dare not. Poor little
girl, how she must ache! Supposing I was that
way. My arms stretched way down there, and
my feet shortened way up here, and my back
all scrouged up so! Oh! poor, poor Mary Jane!
It hurts me just to make believe and she has
it all the time. But here she comes back and
I mustn&#8217;t let her see I notice her looks. I
mustn&#8217;t, for anything. It&#8217;s bad enough to have
her body hurt, I mustn&#8217;t hurt her feelings, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, there was no sign of suffering
about the little cripple as she returned to the
side of her guest, dragging the soap-box wagon
behind her and recklessly rolling the baby about
in it, so eager was her advance. There were
tears in Bonny-Gay&#8217;s eyes for a moment,
though, till she caught sight of the baby and
heard Mary Jane exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such a sight? What do
you s&#8217;pose mother will say? The teacher set
him in the sand-box and somebody gave him a
stick of &#8217;lasses candy, and he&#8217;s messed from
head to foot. But isn&#8217;t he a dear?&#8221; and dropping
to the ground she caught the little one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
her breast and covered his sandy, bedaubed
countenance with adoring kisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the funniest thing I ever saw!&#8221;
laughed Bonny-Gay, so merrily that the Gray
Gentleman drew near to join in the fun. After
him trailed an army of young &#8220;farmers&#8221; and
in another moment the visitor had ceased to be
a stranger to anybody there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see-saw!&#8221; cried Joe Stebbins, seizing
her hand and drawing her to the playground.
Then somebody swung Mary Jane and the baby
upon the beam beside her, some other girls took
the opposite end, and they all went tilting up
and down, up and down, in the most exciting
manner possible. Then there was the Maypole,
furnished with ropes instead of ribbons, from
the ends of which they hung and swung, around
and around, till they dropped off for sheer
weariness. And here Bonny-Gay was proud to
see that Mary Jane could beat the whole company.
Her arms were so long and so strong,
they could cling and outswing all the others;
and when she had held to her rope until she was
the very last one left her laughter rang out in
a way that was good to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me I never heard so much laughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
in all my life!&#8221; exclaimed Bonny-Gay to
the Gray Gentleman when, tired out with fun,
she nestled beside him as he rested on a bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a fine thing, a fine thing. And
you see that it doesn&#8217;t take big houses or rich
clothes to make happiness. All these new
friends of yours belong to those tiny homes we
passed on our way down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do! Even Mary Jane, my sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even in an humbler. Dingy street is just
what its name implies. But we&#8217;ll drive that
way back and what do you say to giving Mary
Jane a ride thus far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;d love it! She&#8217;s so jolly and
friendly and seems never to think of her&mdash;her
poor back and&mdash;things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll like her better and better&mdash;if you
should ever meet again. She won my heart
the first time I saw her, over a month ago. I
met her dragging home a basket of her mother&#8217;s
laundry work, in that same soap-box wagon she
utilizes for the baby. The family chariot it
seems to be. I was taking a stroll this way,
quite by myself, and thinking of other things
than where I was walking when I stumbled and
my hat flew off. Then I heard a rattle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
squeak of rusty small wheels, and there was
Mary Jane hopping up to me on her &#8216;wooden
feet&#8217; and holding out my hat, with the most
sympathetic smile in the world. &#8216;Here it is,
Mister, and I do hope it isn&#8217;t hurt; nor you
either,&#8217; said she; and in just that one glimpse
I had of her I saw how sweet and brave and
helpful she was. So I&#8217;ve been proud to call
her my friend ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then arose a cry so sudden and boisterous
it could have been uttered by no lips except
the baby&#8217;s. For a teacher had tapped a bell,
and somebody had cried &#8216;Luncheon!&#8217; and he
knew what that meant as well as anyone.</p>

<p>So Mary Jane swung round to where he lay
upon his back in the sunshine and set him up
against a rock, and thrust a piece of the loaf she
had brought into his chubby fists, and cocked
her head admiringly while she cried out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did anybody ever see so cute a child as
he!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she remembered the visitors and with
the truest hospitality proffered them the broken
loaf.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to have given it to you the first,
I know that, but he&#8217;d have yelled constant if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
hadn&#8217;t tended him. It&#8217;s wonderful, I think,
how he knows that bell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; echoed the Gray Gentleman,
as he bowed and gravely broke a tiny portion
from the small stale loaf.</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay was going to decline, but when
she saw the Gray Gentleman&#8217;s action, she
checked her &#8220;No, I thank you&#8221; unspoken and
also accepted a crumbly crust. After which
Mary Jane distributed several other bits among
some clamorous charges and finally sat down
with the last morsel to enjoy that herself in
their presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think dinner never tastes so good as it
does out-doors here, in our park,&#8221; she remarked
with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner!&#8221; cried Bonny-Gay and looked into
the Gray Gentleman&#8217;s face. But from something
she saw there she was warned to say no
more; and she made a brave effort to swallow
her own crust without letting her entertainer
see how distasteful a matter it was.</p>

<p>After this the Gray Gentleman saw a cloud
arising and though he did not fear a shower for
himself he was anxious that Bonny-Gay should
take no harm from her unusual outing. So he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
called the coachman to bring up the carriage
and had Mary Jane and the baby lifted in. Then
Bonny-Gay sprang after them, and the master
himself made his adieux to the teachers and followed,
watched by the admiring, maybe envious,
glances of many bright eyes.</p>

<p>However, one carriage, no matter how
capacious, cannot hold a whole kindergarten,
and neither could it carry the pleasant &#8220;Playgrounds&#8221;
away; so if there was any envy it
did not last long. Which was a good thing,
too, seeing what happened so soon afterward.</p>

<p>The landau had not progressed far toward
Dingy street and Mary Jane was still wearing
the feather-trimmed hat, which her new friend
had persuaded her to put on just to surprise
Mrs. Bump, when there came a rush, a bark,
a series of shrieks, and the high-spirited horses
were off at a mad gallop; which grew wilder
and wilder, and soon passed quite beyond control
of coachman or even the Gray Gentleman,
who had promptly seized the reins as they fell
from the driver&#8217;s hands, but had been powerless
to do more than retain them in his tightly
clutched fingers.</p>

<p>It seemed an age that the frantic beasts sped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
onward, following their own will, before the
crash came and they tore themselves free, leaving
the hindering vehicle to go to ruin against
the great post, where it struck. But it was, in
reality, not more than half a moment, and when
the reins were wrenched from his grasp the
Gray Gentleman looked anxiously about him to
learn if anyone was hurt.</p>

<p>Mary Jane and the baby were on the floor
of the carriage, safe and sound. The terrified
footman was clinging to his seat behind; the
coachman had either leaped or been thrown out,
but had landed upon his feet; but where was
Bonny-Gay?</p>

<p>A white, motionless little figure lay face
downward in the dust, a rod away, and over
this bent a black, shaggy dog, whining and
moaning in a way that was almost human.</p>

<p>&#8220;Max! Max! Was it you, was it you!
Oh! wretched animal, what have you done!&#8221;</p>

<p>Max it was. But, at the sight of his silent
playmate and the altered sound of a familiar
voice, a cowed, unhappy Max; who crouched
and slunk away as the Gray Gentleman lifted
from the roadway the limp figure of his own
beloved Bonny-Gay.</p>

<small>MAX REAPPEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was neither drug store nor doctor&#8217;s
office near, and the Gray Gentleman&#8217;s instant
decision was to carry Bonny-Gay to Mrs.
Bump&#8217;s house. Strong man though he was he
felt almost faint with anxiety as he sprang from
the carriage and without losing an instant of
time lifted out Mary Jane and the baby. Then
he dropped her crutches beside her and ran to
the child in the roadway.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Bonny-Gay was lying on
Mrs. Bump&#8217;s bed, and the Gray Gentleman had
gone away in pursuit of aid, leaving a last injunction
behind him as he disappeared:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do everything you can for her, I beg, but
keep useless people out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it was that, though curious faces peered
in at the window, no person save Mrs. Stebbins
crossed the threshold of their neighbor&#8217;s house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and the two women were left unhindered to
minister to the injured child as best they knew
how. They were not able, indeed, to restore
the little girl to consciousness; but they had
cleared the soil of the street from her face and
clothing and had placed the inert figure in an
easy posture, long before there was heard the
rattle and dash of another approaching vehicle,
and a doctor&#8217;s phaeton drew up at the door.</p>

<p>The surgeon&#8217;s examination showed that one
of the child&#8217;s legs was broken but this did not
trouble him half so much as her continued unconsciousness.
But he worked diligently to restore
her and to prepare the injured limb for
removal to her own home.</p>

<p>From a low seat in the corner and hugging
the baby tight, to keep him quiet, Mary Jane
watched the little sufferer upon her mother&#8217;s
bed, with wide, dry eyes and heaving breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if I could only take it for her!&#8221; she
thought, helplessly. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t have mattered
to anybody like me, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m all crooked anyhow;
but her! She was that straight and beautiful&mdash;my
sake! It mustn&#8217;t be&mdash;it mustn&#8217;t!
And she didn&#8217;t mind. She let me wear her
hat, me. Well, that didn&#8217;t get hurt, any way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
It just tumbled off all safe. I had to wear it
home, else I couldn&#8217;t have dragged the baby,
and I don&#8217;t know not a thing whatever became
of his wagon. Never mind that, though. If
she only would open her eyes, just once, just
once!&#8221;</p>

<p>But they had not opened even when, a half-hour
later, another carriage paused before the
Bumps&#8217; tenement, and a tall, pale lady descended,
trembling so that she had almost to be
carried by the Gray Gentleman who supported
her.</p>

<p>This was Mrs. McClure and she had just
been stepping into her own vehicle for a morning&#8217;s
shopping when he reached her door, bringing
his unhappy message. So there was no
time lost in securing a vehicle and the mother
was soon at her child&#8217;s bedside. At any other
hour she might have shrunk from entering so
poor a place but at that moment she had, for
once, forgotten her own high station and
thought only of her darling.</p>

<p>One glimpse of the lovely face, so still and
unresponsive, banished the mother&#8217;s last vestige
of strength and she would have fallen where
she stood, had not Mrs. Bump slipped an arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
about her and motioned Mrs. Stebbins to bring
the one sound chair the room could boast. The
doctor held a glass of water to her lips and the
faintness passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;she&mdash;alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She is still alive,&#8221; answered the physician,
gravely, and Mrs. McClure turned faint
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, she&#8217;s alive, lady; and what&#8217;s
more it won&#8217;t be long, I reckon, before she&#8217;ll be
asking a lot of questions all about what&#8217;s happened
her. Oh! yes indeed. I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em a
sight worst than she is, and up and around
again as lively as crickets. Why, there&#8217;s my
Mary Jane&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the cripple held up a warning finger and
Mrs. Bump ceased speaking. Though not her
helpful ministrations; for with a whisk to the
stove she had seized a coarse brown teapot and
poured from it a hot draught into a cup that
had no handle, indeed, yet could serve as well
as another to refresh an exhausted creature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, honey, just sip this. Strong, I know,
and not the finest, but &#8217;twill set you up, quick.
I know. There, there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moved by the same instinct which had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Bonny-Gay accept her crust dinner, Mrs. McClure
drank the scalding liquid and did, indeed,
revive under it. Then the doctor and the Gray
Gentleman lifted the injured child and placed
her gently upon the carriage seat.</p>

<p>Seeing which, the mother hastily rose and
followed, supported still, though unnoticed on
her part, by the strong arms of the other mother
whose sympathetic tears were now silently
flowing; even while her cheery voice reiterated,
much to the surgeon&#8217;s disgust:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you fear, dear lady. She&#8217;ll be as
right as a trivet. Aye, indeed; she&#8217;ll be talking
to you before you get to your own house. Yes,
indeed. We poor folks see many an accident
and mostly they don&#8217;t amount to much; even
my Mary Jane&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was Mary Jane herself just as the
carriage door was closing, thrusting something
white and feather-trimmed into the pale lady&#8217;s
lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her hat, lady. Bonny-Gay&#8217;s best hat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. McClure was as kind hearted as most,
yet at that moment she was already unstrung,
and the glimpse she caught of poor Mary Jane&#8217;s
deformity shocked her afresh. Without intending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
it she did shrink away from contact
with so &#8220;repulsive&#8221; a child and Mrs. Bump
saw the movement. Her own face hardened
and she withdrew her arm from supporting the
stranger to clasp it about her own child.</p>

<p>But Mary Jane saw nothing, save that Bonny-Gay
was being carried away without her
beautiful headgear, and again she thrust it
eagerly forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her hat! Her lovely hat! She mustn&#8217;t go
without her Sunday hat!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the sweetest, most sympathetic of
voices and almost startling to the rich woman,
coming as it did from such a source. It made
her take a second look at the cripple and this
time, fortunately, the glance rested upon the
child&#8217;s fine, spiritual face. An instant regret
for the repugnance she had first felt shot
through Mrs. McClure&#8217;s mind and leaning from
the carriage window she dropped the hat upon
Mary Jane&#8217;s dark head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it, little girl, as a gift from Bonny-Gay.
It will delight her that you should have
it. Quick now, coachman. Swift and careful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they were all gone and Mary Jane, bedecked
in her unusual finery, stood leaning upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
her crutches, crying as if her heart would break.
Her mother glanced at her hastily but thought
it best to let &#8220;her have her cry out. She cries
so seldom it ought to do her good,&#8221; she reflected.
Besides, there was the baby rolling on
the floor, in imminent danger from a wash-boiler
full of steaming water; and a whole hour
wasted from her own exacting labors.</p>

<p>Presently, the hunchback felt something cold
and wet touch her down-hanging hand and
dashed the tears from her eyes to see what it
might be. There sat a great black dog beside
her, so close that he almost forced her crutch
away. His eyes were fixed upon her face in a
mute appeal for sympathy, and his whole bearing
showed as much sorrow as her tears had
done. Her first impulse was to shrink away
from him, even to strike at him with the crutch,
as she indignantly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the very dog did it! You jumped
into the wagon and scared the horses. If it
hadn&#8217;t been for you she wouldn&#8217;t have been
hurt. Go &#8217;way! Go away off out of sight!
You horrid, ugly, mean old dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s vehemence surprised even herself
and she shook her head so vigorously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
that the feather-trimmed hat fell off into
the dust.</p>

<p>Then was a transformation. Max&mdash;it was,
indeed he!&mdash;had already dropped flat upon his
stomach and crouched thus, whining and moaning
in a manner that betokened such suffering
that it quickly conquered the cripple&#8217;s anger;
and now, as the hat fell right before his nose,
he began to smell of it and lick it with the most
extravagant joy. A moment later he had sprung
up, caught the hat in his teeth, and was gambolling
all around and around Mary Jane,
as if he were the very happiest dog in the
world.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sake! How you act! And oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!
I know you, I know you! You must be
that Max-dog that she told me about. That
she&#8217;d known all her life and wouldn&#8217;t be let
come any more to her park! I guess I can see
the whole thing. I guess you run away from
that man the gardener gave you to. Maybe
you went right back to where &#8216;Father George&#8217;
and the lion are; and maybe you saw Bonny-Gay
and the Gray Gentleman come away; and
maybe you followed them. Maybe it was because
you were so glad, and not bad, that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
jumped into the carriage and scared the horses.
Oh! you poor doggie, if that is how it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Which was, in fact, exactly what had happened;
and it seemed that the intelligent animal,
who had loved Bonny-Gay ever since she was
first wheeled about the beautiful Place in her
baby-carriage, had now a comprehension of the
damage his delight at finding her again had
done.</p>

<p>So Mary Jane hopped back into the house
and called Max by that name to follow her.
He did so, readily, and sat down very near to
the foot of the bed on which she carefully placed
his little mistress&#8217; hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, daughter, this has been a morning,
hasn&#8217;t it? Now, these handkerchiefs are ready
to iron and I&#8217;ve fixed your high seat right close
to my tub, so whilst I wash you can iron away
and tell me the whole story and all about it.
Here comes father, too, and it&#8217;ll pass the time
for him to hear it. And, oh! William! you
never could guess whatever has happened right
here in this very kitchen, this very morning that
ever was! But, I must work now, and Mary
Jane&#8217;ll talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talk she did and fast; and under her eloquence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Bonny-Gay became quite the most
wonderful child in the world:</p>

<p>&#8220;The beautifullest, the kindest, the friendliest
that ever lived. It didn&#8217;t &#8217;pear to make a
mite of difference that she was all so fixed up in
her clothes; she played games as lively as the
next one. She hung on to the Maypole ropes
near as long as I did, and if I&#8217;d known what
was coming I&#8217;d have dropped off quick and let
her win the count. And my! how she did enjoy
her dinner off my loaf! To see her little white
hands hold it up to her lips and see her just
nibble, nibble&mdash;Why, mother Bump! &#8217;Twould
have done your heart good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat your dinner, did she? Wish to goodness
it had choked her!&#8221; growled William
Bump, from the doorstep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, father! W-h-y!&#8221; gasped Mary
Jane, amazed.</p>

<p>The man replied only by whistling Max to
him, and by stroking the dog&#8217;s head when the
whistle had been obeyed.</p>

<p>But when the cripple had reached that part of
her story descriptive of the final accident, the
father spoke again and this time with even a
more vindictive earnestness than before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Broke her leg, did it? Glad of it. Never
was gladder of anything in all my life. Hope
she&#8217;ll suffer a lot. Hope&mdash;What better is she,
his little girl, than you, my Mary Jane? Glad
there is something that evens matters up. I
hope his heart&#8217;ll ache till it comes as near
breakin&#8217; as mine&mdash;every time I look at your
poor crooked shoulders, you poor miserable
child! So I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Mrs. Bump and Mary Jane were aghast
at the awfulness of this desire. Even the baby
had paused open-mouthed and silent, as if he,
too, could comprehend the dreadful words and
be shocked by them. Only Max remained undisturbed,
even nestled the closer to the blue-shirted
man, who in some manner reminded
him of his old master, Mr. Weems.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Bump found her voice, and
though she was a loyal wife she did not hesitate
in this emergency to give her husband a
very indignant reproof. So indignant, in fact,
that she forgot the caution of many years, and
with her hand on William&#8217;s shoulder, demanded
fiercely:</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that, you? You! You dare to
rejoice in the misfortunes of others when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
was by your own fault&mdash;your own fault, William
Bump!&mdash;that our poor lass sits yonder a
cripple for life. When I left her in your care
that I might go and intercede for you to be
given a fresh trial at the works, what was it
but that you loved the drink better than the
child? and left her on the high ledge while you
slept&mdash;a human log! Yet you were sorry
enough afterwards and you should take shame
to yourself for your wickedness. It&#8217;s the drink
again that&#8217;s in you, this day; and that has lost
you another job and turned your once good
heart into a cruel beast&#8217;s! So that is what I
think of you, and my&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she turned and there sat Mary Jane,
listening, horror-struck and broken-hearted!</p>

<p>Regret was useless. The secret, guarded so
jealously for years, was now disclosed. Till
then the hunchback had believed her affliction
was hers from birth, and had never dreamed
that it was the result of a terrible fall, due to
her own father&#8217;s carelessness. He had always
seemed to love her so, with a sort of remorseful
tenderness quite different from the attention he
gave to his other, healthier children. But if it
had all been by his fault!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Poor Mary Jane! Alas, alas! Far worse
for her was the anger and hatred that at that
moment sprang to life in her tortured heart.
As in a picture she saw other little maids, her
playmates, even this recent vision of Bonny-Gay,
straight-limbed, strong, active, enjoying
everything without aid of those hindering
crutches or the heavy dragging limbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! father! you did it? you! And I ought
to have been like them&mdash;I ought&mdash;I ought!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody spoke after that. Mary Jane&#8217;s head
sank down upon the high table where stood her
little flatiron, fast cooling. Mrs. Bump felt a
new and deadly faintness seize her own vigorous
body and sat weakly down. How could she
undo the mischief she had wrought? Until
now there had been between the father and the
child such a wonderful affection that it had been
a matter of constant comment among all the
neighbors, and the mother had been proud that
this was so. Now&mdash;what had she done, what
had she done!</p>

<p>Presently, William Bump rose, put on his
hat, whistled to Max, and walked out. At the
door he paused, cast one miserable glance over
the little room and his face was very white beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
its stains of toil and weather. His eyes
seemed mutely to seek for one ray of pity, of
forgiveness; but Mary Jane&#8217;s head was still
upon the table and her mother&#8217;s face was hidden
in her own labor-hardened palms.</p>

<p>Only the baby began to coo and gurgle in
a way which, under ordinary circumstances,
would have elicited admiring exclamations, but
which now secured no response. So, then he
rolled over and closed his eyes; and not even
he saw when the man and the dog passed clear
out of sight, across the open lots, and toward
the marshy places which led to the water and
the unknown country beyond.</p>

<p>By-and-by, the other children came home
from the &#8220;Playgrounds,&#8221; full of chatter about
the day&#8217;s delights and eager with questions concerning
the wonderful happening of Mary
Jane&#8217;s ride. Then the mother roused and kept
them from troubling their sister, and dispatched
them to examine the wrecked carriage, away
down the street.</p>

<p>By the time they returned Mary Jane&#8217;s eyes
were no longer red and there was nothing out
of common in her manner. Mrs. Bump was
ironing away as if her life depended on it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
even humming the first strains of a hymn,
&#8220;Lord, in the morning, Thou shalt, Thou shalt&mdash;Lord,
in the morning Thou shalt hear.&#8221;
This always denoted an extra cheerfulness on
the singer&#8217;s part, and the children became boisterously
happy in proportion.</p>

<p>When supper time came they &#8220;set a place
for father,&#8221; just as always; and though even
by the end of the meal he had not appeared
his unused plate was still left, as if he might
come in at any moment.</p>

<p>Yet it was quite midnight when Mary Jane,
for once unable to sleep, crept down to her
mother&#8217;s room and called, softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he come, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No dearie, not yet. But it&#8217;s not late, you
know for&mdash;him!&#8221; replied the wife, so cheerfully,
that even her quick-witted daughter did
not suspect the heartache beneath the cheerfulness,
nor the tear-stained face upon the pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he does, I wish you&#8217;d call me. I
must tell him it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s all just right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, darling. Trust mother and go to sleep
now. I&#8217;ll call you sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>And neither guessed how long that call would
be delayed.</p>

<small>MARY JANE GOES VISITING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Mary Jane Bump was not the girl to be
gloomy over anything for very long; least of
all over anything so trifling as her own personal
afflictions; and the morning saw her hopping
about in her narrow home, as merry, as loving,
and as helpful as ever. Even more helpful, it
seemed to the conscience-stricken mother, than
before she had felt the fierce anger of the previous
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Appears like she&#8217;d try to make even me
forget she ever heard what I said, poor lamb!
Well, I still think, what I&#8217;ve so often thought,
that the Lord did bring sweet out of that bitter,
when He made her so beautiful inside, even if
she is crooked without. And more&#8217;n that, to
me she don&#8217;t seem so misshaped. I almost
forget she ain&#8217;t just like the rest. Aye, honey?
What&#8217;s that you say?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;If you can spare me, mother, after all the
work is done, I&#8217;d like to go to Bonny-Gay&#8217;s
house and find out about her. Oh! do you
s&#8217;pose she will get well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess she will, too. Can I, mother?
When the work&#8217;s all done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, my lass, and that will never be.
So there&#8217;s no use tarrying for such a time. And
I don&#8217;t blame you for wanting to go. I&#8217;d admire
to hear myself. But I guess it&#8217;s a long
step from here and I don&#8217;t know the way, even
I don&#8217;t. You&#8217;d have to ride in a street car
and that costs money&mdash;which is one of the
things I can least spare.&#8221;</p>

<p>At mention of the car, Mary Jane&#8217;s eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p>On rare occasions&mdash;once when she went to
market with her mother, at holiday time, and
once when the wash had been too large and the
patron&#8217;s home too distant for even her nimble
crutches&mdash;she had enjoyed the luxury of travel
by electricity. In imagination, she could still
feel the swift rush of air against her cheek,
could see the houses hurrying past, and hear
the delightful ting-a-ling of the bell, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
motorman stopped to let the passengers on or
off. She had not dreamed that it would be
necessary for her to ride, in order to pay the
visit she desired; but if it were&mdash;Oh! felicity!</p>

<p>The light in the eyes she loved decided the
mother upon the indulgence. A car-ride meant
a nickel, or part of one, at least, for even little
Mary Jane; and a nickel would buy a loaf, and
many loaves were needful where there were
seven mouths to fill, and every mouth a hungry
one. More than that, if William were out of
work&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bump considered no further. Mary
Jane should have the pleasure&mdash;no matter what
happened afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you&#8217;ll ride! Why not? Don&#8217;t
suppose I&#8217;d let you start off a-foot for such a
length, do you? I&#8217;ve a notion that this Mt.
Vernon Place is away at the other end the city.
Leastwise, it must be a good bit from Dingy
street, &#8217;cause I never heard of it before, and
I&#8217;ve been around the neighborhood considerable,
with the wash, you know. Yes, you may go.
Fly round right smart and get your clothes
changed. What a fine thing it is that your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
other frock is clean, and I must say I did have
good luck ironing it, last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always do have good luck, mother
Bump! You&#8217;re the very loveliest ironer in the
world!&#8221; and the wooden feet clicked across the
room that their owner might hug this famous
laundress.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re a partial little girl, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, mother, dear, the work isn&#8217;t done&mdash;yet.
There&#8217;s the steps to be scrubbed and that
other pile of hank&#8217;chiefs, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon we&#8217;ll live just as long if our
steps ain&#8217;t done for one day in the year. Besides,
I might let one the younger ones do them
and see. They&#8217;re always teasing to, you know.
Strange, how human nature loves to mess in a
pail of soap and water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;ll mind the baby, if I go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, Mary Jane Bump! Seem to think
the precious youngster ain&#8217;t hardly safe in his
own mother&#8217;s hands, do you? Run along, run
along, girlie, and fix yourself fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away up the narrow stair swung happy Mary
Jane; and in a very few moments down she
swung again. She had exchanged her blue
gingham for her pink print, had dusted off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
shoes which, alas! were so useless that they
rarely wore out! and had brushed her dark
wavy hair till it floated about her sweet face,
as fine and fleece-like as it was possible for hair
to be. In her hands she carried two hats; her
own little plain &#8220;sailor,&#8221; and the gift of Bonny-Gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I wouldn&#8217;t wear&mdash;&#8221; began Mrs. Bump,
answering the question in Mary Jane&#8217;s eyes;
then seeing the disappointment which crept into
them, hastily altered her original judgment to
fit the case. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t wear that old &#8216;sailor&#8217;
if I was a little girl that owned feathers like
those. Indeedy, that I wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s face rippled with smiles and for
almost the first time in her life she did a coquettish
thing. Standing upon her crutches before
the tiny looking-glass, hung at an angle above
the mantel, she adjusted and readjusted the
pretty leghorn, until she had placed it as nearly
in the position it had occupied on Bonny-Gay&#8217;s
yellow curls as she could. Then she wheeled
about and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it look right, mother? Just as right
as she would like to have it, when she sees
me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;Perfect, honey! And though I maybe
oughtn&#8217;t to say it before you, you&#8217;re the very
sweetest little girl in Baltimore city!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but, mother Bump, you haven&#8217;t seen
all the others!&#8221; laughed the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, here&#8217;s your money. Two nickels,
dear. I&#8217;ve just given them a bit of a polish in
the suds while you were up-stairs. One is to
go with, and one to come home. I&#8217;ve been
puzzling it out, and the best thing is for you to
go to the nearest car-line you find; then ask
the conductor how nigh it will take you to the
Place. He&#8217;ll be kind to you, I know. They&#8217;re
always obliging, the conductors are, and when
it&#8217;s anybody like you, why they just seem to
tear themselves to pieces to be nice. You&#8217;ll
have no trouble, honey, not a mite. And when
you get there, don&#8217;t forget to make your manners,
pretty, like I&#8217;ve taught you. Say everything
to cheer the lady up, if she seems down-hearted
a bit, and good-by, good-by. Bless you,
Mary Jane!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bump stood at her doorway and Mrs.
Stebbins at hers, to watch the little figure hop
away, and when it turned at the corner and they
caught a glimpse of the radiant face beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
the picture-hat, they smiled upon each other
well satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm&#8217;ll happen to her!&#8221; said Mrs. Stebbins,
confidently. &#8220;She&#8217;s one of the Lord&#8217;s
own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not fearing! though I&#8217;m going to miss
her powerful,&#8221; answered the mother, and retired
to her tub.</p>

<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s heart beat so with excitement
that she could hardly breathe. Here she was,
going alone on an unknown journey, to ride
in a car quite by herself, and to pay her own
fare exactly as if she were a grown-up. She
had to tightly clutch that corner of her little
handkerchief wherein the nickles were tied, to
make herself realize the delightful fact; and
already, in her dutiful heart, she was planning
how she could save, by not eating quite so much
of her portion of food, and so, in time, make
up to her mother for this unwonted extravagance.</p>

<p>Indeed, she thought so fast and deeply, that
she stood on the corner and let the first car go
by without signalling it. Then she brought her
wits to the present and when the next one
whizzed up she was ready for it, raising her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
hand and motioning it to stop, as she had seen
other people do.</p>

<p>It did stop, of course, and to such a little
passenger, also, of course, the conductor was
quite as kind as Mrs. Bump had prophesied he
would be. He lifted Mary Jane into the very
front seat of all and he would have been glad
not to take a fare from her. But this his duty
compelled him to do, and when he had received
it he paused a moment beside her to inquire:</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking a ride, are you? Well, it&#8217;s a nice
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it! Just beautiful. Yes, I&#8217;m going to
Mt. Vernon Place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! you are? Well, this is the wrong
car&mdash;Never mind. You can transfer. Mt.
Vernon Place is a long way from here and quite
the swellest part of the town; you know that,
I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s where Bonny-Gay lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! indeed. Well, don&#8217;t you worry. I&#8217;ll
look out for you and pass you along. Company
allows only one transfer, now, but I&#8217;ll fix it.
It&#8217;ll be all right. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane had not the slightest intention of
worrying. That was something she had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
done until the night before, and then about her
missing father. But in this brilliant sunshine,
with the world all her own, so to speak, even
that anxiety had disappeared. He would be
sure to return and very soon. He loved them
all so dearly, and even for herself, if there were
none others, he would come. He couldn&#8217;t live
without her; he had often told her so. Therefore
she merely hoped he was having as good
a time, at that moment, as she was; and settled
herself serenely in her place to enjoy everything.</p>

<p>She never forgot the first part of that day&#8217;s
ride. There were few passengers in the car
and these were all men, quite able to look out
for themselves; so the conductor remained near
her and talked of the places they passed, pointing
out this building and that, for Mary Jane&#8217;s
enlightenment. She bestowed upon each an
attention that was quite flattering to her entertainer,
till the car turned another corner
and he had to move away. People came more
frequently now and at every block of their advance,
the men and women seemed to Mary
Jane to crowd and hurry more and more. They
almost crushed her own small person, climbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
past her, but she still clung sturdily to the outer
corner of her seat, as her friend, the conductor,
had bidden her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No need for you to move up, little girl.
You&#8217;ll be changing after a bit, and it&#8217;ll be easier
for them than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Right in the very business part of the city
the car stopped and he came back to her, thrusting
a pale green slip of paper into her hand,
and hurriedly lifting her out.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your transfer. Yonder&#8217;s your car.
Give that paper to the other conductor. He&#8217;ll
help you on. Say, Snyder!&#8221; he called to his
co-laborer. &#8220;This kid&#8217;s for Vernon Place. Put
her off at Charles street, will you? and pass her
along. I&#8217;ll make it right with the company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he was gone and Mary Jane stood bewildered
in the midst of a throng of vehicles,
and street cars, and busy, rushing people. For
an instant her head whirled, then she saw the
impatient beckoning of conductor Snyder, and
swung herself toward the waiting car. A man,
into whose path she had hopped, caught her
up and placed her on the platform, and again
she was off.</p>

<p>But this time she was merely one of a crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and the ticket collecting kept Mr. Snyder too
busy to bother with any single passenger. Indeed,
some slight hindrance just as they reached
Charles street put Mary Jane and her destination
quite out of mind, and it was not until
they had gone some blocks beyond and he had
chanced to come near her again that she ventured
to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we almost there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he said&mdash;Charles street,&#8221; she answered
abashed by his brusque manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles street! Why, that&#8217;s long back.
Did you want to get off there? Oh! I forgot.
You&#8217;re the child&mdash;Well, such as you ought not
to be traveling alone. Here. I&#8217;ll put you off
now, you can walk back. Ask anybody you
meet, and they&#8217;ll direct you. Wait. I&#8217;ll give
you another transfer. It&#8217;s against rules, but
the other fellow&#8217;s responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time it was a yellow slip Mary Jane
received and again she was set down in the
midst of a confusing crowd. She was in imminent
danger of being run over, and saw that; so
promptly retreated to the curbstone and from
thence watched the unending procession of cars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
which followed one another without a moment&#8217;s
break. For just there it happened that many
railway lines used the same tracks and it would
have puzzled a much more experienced person
than Mary Jane to distinguish between them.</p>

<p>Finally, she grew so tired and confused with
the watching and the racket that she resolved
to walk; and set out boldly in the direction from
which she had come, scanning the street name-signs
upon the corners. It seemed to her she
would never come to that she sought, but she
did, at last; and here a new difficulty presented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way shall I go? this&mdash;or that? Oh!
dear! The time is going so fast and I don&#8217;t
get there. I&#8217;ll have to ask somebody the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>But though she made several shy little efforts
to attract attention, not a passer-by paused to
answer her low question. Almost all fancied
her an unfortunate, petitioning alms; and some
thought her a street merchant with something
to sell. Many and many an one had gone by,
till in the midst of all these men she saw a
woman.</p>

<p>Only a scrub-woman, to be sure, on her way
to some office to her daily labor; but she paused
when the cripple spoke to her and looked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
feminine curiosity at the plainly clothed child in
her expensive hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mt. Vernon Place! Why, child alive, it&#8217;s
miles from here! Away up yonder. This is
Charles and it does run straight enough, that&#8217;s
so, to where you want to go. But it&#8217;s so far,
little girl. And you a cripple. You&#8217;d much
best go back home and let some older person do
your errand. Whatever was your ma thinkin&#8217;
of, to send you such a bout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t send me, I came because I
wished. Can you tell me which car is right?
and will this yellow ticket pay my way?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman examined the transfer-slip,
glanced at a clock on a near-by building, and
shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the car, all right, but that transfer&#8217;s
no good. After fifteen minutes they won&#8217;t take
&#8217;em, and it&#8217;s half an hour or more. No. You&#8217;ll
have to pay a second fare. I&#8217;ll help you on, if
you like. Where do you live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ninety-seven, Dingy street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The land! That&#8217;s almost the jumping off
place of the city. Did they give you only
money enough to ride twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother gave me ten cents,&#8221; answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Mary Jane, proudly, yet somehow, the fortune
which had seemed so big, a little while before,
now appeared very small and inadequate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! If I had a cent I&#8217;d give it to you.
I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;d better do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. I&#8217;ll walk. And thank you for telling
me the way. If I keep right on this street,
and go up and up, will I surely, surely get
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. I know, &#8217;cause I used to clean up in
that neighborhood. I hope you&#8217;ll have luck.
Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; answered Mary Jane, smilingly.</p>

<p>The momentary pause and conversation had
rested her and she now felt wholly equal to any
demands upon her strength. If she had merely
to follow this one avenue till she came in sight
of the monument and the lion, why! that was
as easy as A, B, C! So she set out with fresh
courage and full enjoyment of every novel sight
or sound by the way; though, all the while,
watchfully reading the street sign at every
corner she reached.</p>

<p>It was almost two hours later that she came
in sight of the Place. She knew it in a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
even though she had had but the one brief description
of it from Bonny-Gay&#8217;s lips, and she
felt as if she had come into a new and wonderful
world.</p>

<p>&#8220;How big and still and&mdash;and&mdash;finished it
looks! And, oh! how tired I am. My arms
ache like they never did before, and I can hardly
hold my crutches. I&#8217;ll get to that low stone
round the monument&mdash;that&#8217;s where she sits
with the Gray Gentleman&mdash;and I&#8217;ll get rested.
Then I&#8217;ll look all around and pick out her house.
I shall know it because she said it was all covered
with vines and there was a big yard behind,
with trees and things. Oh! how good it is to
sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>So good, indeed, that before she knew it the
exhausted little maid had dropped her head
upon the curbing and fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>There Mr. Weems discovered her and would
have roused her to send her home. But a second
glance at her convinced him that this was
no child of that locality, and that she seemed
a very weary little girl, indeed. So he simply
folded his own jacket and placed it under her
head and left her to recover herself.</p>

<p>She awoke after a little time and sat up, confused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
and rather frightened. Till she suddenly
remembered where she was and, seeing a gardener
at work upon a grass-plot near, decided
at once that he must be the owner of Max. She
saw, too, the coat which had formed her pillow
and knew that he must have placed it there.
With a glad cry she caught up her crutches and
swung herself toward the keeper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! sir, I thank you. I was so tired and
the coat was lovely soft. And I know you.
You&#8217;re Mr. Weems, the gardener, and I&#8217;ve seen
Max. He&#8217;s at our house, I mean he was&mdash;last
night. And he will be again, &#8217;cause he&#8217;s with
father, who&#8217;ll fetch him back. Father just
loves dogs and animals. And say, please, which
is Bonny-Gay&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul! You don&#8217;t say? Then you
must belong around here, though I didn&#8217;t think
it. You&#8217;ve seen Max, and you ask for our
Bonny-Gay! Well, you&#8217;ve struck trouble both
times. He&#8217;s in trouble enough, but she in worse.
That&#8217;s her home, yonder, on the west corner.
The green house I call it; with those doctors&#8217;
carriages in front of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is? Why, how funny. What&#8217;s all that
straw for?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The gardener shook his head, sadly, and
hastily flicked away at his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s to deaden all the noise. Bonny-Gay
is a very, very sick little girl and there&#8217;s
about one chance in a thousand, folks think,
for her to get well. She was in an accident,
yesterday. Got thrown out a carriage. The
gentleman that took her driving is almost
crazy with grief about it and&mdash;What&#8217;s that?
What&#8217;s that you say? You was with her?
You? And that&#8217;s her hat&mdash;Upon my word, it
is. She showed it to me, the very first day
she had it, while she was out here waiting to
go driving with her folks. And she&#8217;s the only
one they&#8217;ve got. I reckon her poor father
would give all his millions of dollars and not
stop a minute to think about it, if he could
make her well by doing it. Poor man, I pity
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Max did it, you know. I&#8217;ve come
to see her, and you mustn&#8217;t tell me she&#8217;s so sick
as that. Why, she was that beautiful to me&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Waiting not an instant longer, and despite
the gardener&#8217;s warning, Mary Jane clicked
across the smooth path, over the street, and up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
to the very front door of the mansion, wherein
lay a precious little form, incessantly watched
by a crowd of nurses and friends.</p>

<p>The outer door was ajar, a footman standing
just within, keeping guard and ready to answer
in a whisper the constant string of inquiries
which neighbors sent to make. Past him, while
he was talking to another, slipped Mary Jane,
her crutches making no sound upon the thick
carpet. One thought possessed her, one only;
and made her almost unconscious of the novel
scenes about her. Bonny-Gay was ill. Bonny-Gay
might die. Well, she would have one more
glimpse of that beloved face, no matter who
tried to stop her.</p>

<p>Her brain worked fast. Sick people were
generally up-stairs; up-stairs she sped. Sick
folks had to be quiet. She paused an instant
and peered down the dim corridor. She saw
that as the people passing along this hall approached
a distant door they moved even more
gently and cautiously. In that room, then, lay
her darling!</p>

<p>It seemed like the passage of some bird, so
swift she was and so unerring, for before even
the most watchful of the nurses could intervene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
she had entered the darkened chamber and
crossed to a white cot in the middle of it. By
that time it was too late to stop her. Any noise,
any excitement, however trivial, might prove
fatal, the doctors thought.</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay lay, shorn of her beautiful curls,
almost as white as her pillows. But the small
head moved restlessly, incessantly, and the silence
of the night had given place to a delirious,
rambling talk. All her troubled fancies seemed
to be of the last scenes she had witnessed: the
&#8220;Playgrounds,&#8221; with the eager children crowding
them. She was see-sawing with Jimmy
O&#8217;Brien, and hoeing cabbages with the baby.
She laughed at some inner picture of his absurd
accidents, and finally, as some peril menaced
him, raised her shoulders slightly and shrieked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Jane! Oh! Mary Jane&mdash;come
quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>All the watchers caught their breath&mdash;startled,
fearful of the worst. Yet upon the
silence that followed the cry, there rose the
sweetest, the gladdest of voices:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Bonny-Gay! I&#8217;ve come!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE FLIGHT AND FRIGHT OF MARY JANE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> Mary Jane&#8217;s thoughts had been swift.
She recalled the fact that &#8220;when Joe Stebbins
had the fever and talked crazy-like, the doctor
said we must answer just as if &#8217;twas the way
he said. &#8217;Twould have made him worse to
argue him different,&#8221; and with this reflection
made her instant response.</p>

<p>Now Bonny-Gay had either been less ill than
they fancied, or the crisis had been reached;
for at that cheerful reply she opened her blue
eyes and looked into the eager face so near
them. For a brief time she said no more, seeming
to seek for some explanation of those
troubled dreams from the steadfast smile of her
new friend; then she stretched out her hand and
Mary Jane caught it rapturously between her
own palms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you look nice in my hat. But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;I was at your park. Yet
it&#8217;s home, isn&#8217;t it, after all. How dark it is, and
how tired I am. I guess I&#8217;ll go to sleep a few
minutes. Though I&#8217;m very pleased to see you,
Mary Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the hearts of all in the room shot
a thrill of thankfulness, yet nobody moved as
the injured child dropped at once into a quiet
sleep which meant, the doctors knew, the saving
of her life and reason.</p>

<p>Mrs. McClure had kept up bravely, till that
moment, but now her strength was leaving her
in the shock of her sudden relief and joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the girl not to move nor draw her
hand away&mdash;till Bonny herself releases it;&#8221; she
whispered, as an attendant led her noiselessly
out of the chamber.</p>

<p>She did not know how long and difficult a
task she had set the unwelcome visitor; for
while she herself sank into a much needed rest
the sick child still slept that deep, refreshing
slumber which was to restore her to health.</p>

<p>The hours passed. The doctors went silently
away. One nurse took up a watchful position
near the bed and remained almost as motionless
as the chair she occupied. A gray-haired man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
appeared at the doorway, took one long, delighted
look at the small figure on the cot,
barely seeing the other child beside it, and went
away again. This was the anxious father and
he moved with the lightness of one from whom
an intolerable burden has been removed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a second nurse took observation
now and then of Mary Jane. The position into
which the cripple had sprung, in her eager clasp
of Bonny-Gay&#8217;s hand, was a trying one. Half-bent
forward, with no support for any portion
of her body save that sidewise seat upon the
foot of the cot, it was inevitable that muscles
should stiffen and limbs ache, even in a stronger
frame than Mary Jane&#8217;s. Besides that, she was
very hungry, almost faint. Her slight breakfast
had been taken very early, and since then
she had not tasted any food, though it was now
midafternoon. Presently, she felt her head
grow dizzy. Bonny-Gay&#8217;s face upon the pillow
appeared to be strangely contorted and the clasp
of the small hand within her own to become
vise-like and icy in its grip. She began to
suffer tortures, all over, everywhere. Even her
useless legs were prickling and &#8220;going to
sleep,&#8221; like any overtaxed limb. She feared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
she would fall forward, in spite of all her will,
and that might mean&mdash;death to Bonny-Gay!
She knew, of her own intuition, that she must
not move, even without the whispered command
of Mrs. McClure, and in her heart she
began to say a little prayer for strength to hold
herself steady till her task was at an end.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, she felt that the crutches
resting against her side were being noiselessly
lifted away. Somebody, who moved as if on
air, was putting a rolled up pillow under her
own tired chest; another at her side&mdash;her back;
and beneath the heavy feet a great soft cushion
that was like her own mother&#8217;s lap, for restfulness.</p>

<p>She turned her head and looked up into the
kind face of the trained nurse and smiled her
most grateful smile, for she dared not speak.
The white-capped woman smiled back and silently
held forward a plate on which was some
carefully cut up food. Then she forked a morsel
and held it to Mary Jane&#8217;s lips, which opened
and closed upon it with an eagerness that was
almost greedy, so famished was she.</p>

<p>&#8220;How queer it is!&#8221; thought the little girl,
&#8220;that anybody should bother that way about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
just me!&#8221; then swallowed another mouthful of
the delicious chicken. A bit of roll followed
the chicken, and after that a glass of milk.
With every portion so administered, Mary
Jane&#8217;s fatigue and dizziness disappeared till,
by the time the nurse had fed her all that the
plate contained, she felt so rested and refreshed
she fancied that she could have sat on thus forever,
if Bonny-Gay had so needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how good I feel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay was awake at last, and, of her
own accord, withdrew her hand from Mary
Jane&#8217;s clasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, is that you, Mary Jane? Why
doesn&#8217;t somebody make it light in here? How
came you&mdash;Oh! I remember. You came to see
me and I went to sleep. I don&#8217;t know what
made me do that. Wasn&#8217;t very polite, was it?
Now, I&#8217;ll get up and be dressed and then we&#8217;ll
play something.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as she tried to rise she sank back in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer. There&#8217;s something the matter
with me. One of my legs feels&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t
feel at all. Seems as if it was a marble leg,
like &#8216;Father George&#8217;s.&#8217; Whatever ails me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Mary Jane&#8217;s answer was prompt enough,
though the nurses would have suppressed it if
they had had time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s broken. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Broken! My leg? What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I forgot. You haven&#8217;t been real awake
since it happened. Max&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Child!&#8221; interposed the nurse who had fed
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! mustn&#8217;t I tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>The two white-capped women exchanged
glances. After all, their patient would have to
learn about her own condition; and children
had often ways of their own which proved
wiser than grown folks thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-s, you may tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were thrown out the carriage. Don&#8217;t
you remember? Max had run away to find
you, and when he did, he didn&#8217;t stop to think
of anything else. He just jumped right into
the carriage, where you and the Gray Gentleman
and the baby and I were all riding splendid.
That made the horses afraid and they
acted bad. You got tumbled out and broke
your leg. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s&mdash;all! Why, Mary Jane! You say
it as if&mdash;as if&mdash;you didn&#8217;t care!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay began to cry, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes I did say that&#8217;s all, because that
isn&#8217;t much. It&#8217;s a good job it wasn&#8217;t your
head. A broken leg gets well quick; quicker&#8217;n
ever if it&#8217;s only a little leg like yours. If it
was your mother&#8217;s now, or your father&#8217;s, you
might worry. But, my sake! I wouldn&#8217;t
mind a little thing like that if I were you.
To lie in this heavenly room, with all the
pictures and pretty things, and folks to wait
on you every minute, why&mdash;I&#8217;d think I was
the best off little girl in the world if I were
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t walk on it, nobody knows when.
Nor go out-doors, nor&mdash;nor&mdash;I think you&#8217;re a
mean girl, Mary Jane Bump!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cripple was too astonished to reply. She
had pushed herself from her hard position upon
the cot&#8217;s foot to a chair which the nurse had
placed for her, and was leaning back in it with
supreme content. In all her little life she had
never sat upon anything so luxurious and restful.
How could any child mind anything, who
was as fortunate as the daughter of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
home? Astonishment, also, at finding that her
new friend was not wholly the &#8220;angel&#8221; she had
hitherto supposed her to be, kept her silent. But
she was rather glad to find this out. It made
the other girl seem nearer to her own level of
imperfection, and she speedily reflected that
sick people were often cross, yet didn&#8217;t mean
to be so.</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay herself swiftly repented her hard
speech and looking around the room, inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I sleep very long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, a long time. We are all so glad
of that,&#8221; answered the nurse, holding a spoon to
the patient&#8217;s lips, just as she had done to
Mary Jane&#8217;s, who laughed outright exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the funniest thing! When I was
holding your hand, Bonny-Gay, she fed me just
that way, too! Me! Mary Jane Bump!
Chicken, and biscuit and milk! &#8217;Twas prime,
I tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fed you? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I was holding your hand and
couldn&#8217;t feed myself. I s&#8217;pose she thought,
maybe, I was hungry. I was, too.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;Did you hold it all the time I was asleep,
Mary Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Course. You wasn&#8217;t to be waked up
till you did it yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s silence; then said Bonny-Gay:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too ashamed of myself to look at you.
What must you think of me, Mary Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I love you, dearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can, but I&#8217;m glad of
it. Where is my mother, nurse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. McClure bent over the cot and kissed
her daughter, murmuring tender words of love
and delight; and for a space neither remembered
Mary Jane.</p>

<p>However, she had just remembered her own
mother and the fact that she had been long from
home. Also, that that home lay at the end of a
long, strange and distracting journey, for one
so ignorant of travel as she, and that through
the window she could see that it was already
twilight. She waited a bit, for a chance to
bid good-night to Bonny-Gay and to say how
glad she was that she was better, and to thank
the nurse for being so kind to herself. But nobody
seemed to have any thought for her just
then.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>The gray-haired father had come into the
room and bent beside his wife over the cot
where lay their one darling child; and, seeing
the parents thus occupied with their own feelings,
both nurses had considerately turned their
backs upon the scene and were busying themselves
in arranging the chamber for the night&#8217;s
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not wait a minute longer! I should
be afraid, I think, to get in the car alone at
night. I was hardly ever out after dark. I&#8217;d
like to make my manners pretty, as mother
said, but I can&#8217;t wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moved by the same delicacy which had made
the nurses turn their backs upon the group at
the bedside, Mary Jane silently picked up her
crutches and hopped away. Finding the way
out was easier, even, than finding it in. The
halls were now all lighted by wonderful lamps
overhead and the same stately footman stood
just within the outer entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;However did such a creature as this get
in and I not see her?&#8221; he wondered, as the
little hunchback came swiftly toward him.
&#8220;Well, better out than in, that&#8217;s sure. No
knowing what harm it would do the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
missy if she caught sight of an object like
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Which shows how little the people who live
in one house may understand of each other&#8217;s
ideas; and explains the rapidity with which he
showed Mary Jane through the door and closed
it upon her.</p>

<p>After the lighted hallway the outside world
seemed darker than ever, even though the days
were yet long and twilight lingered. But to-night
the sky was clouded and a storm impending.
Already in the west there were
flashes of lightning, and though, in ordinary,
Mary Jane delighted in an electric storm, just
then it made her think the more longingly of
home and its security.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, if I should get my fresh clean dress
all wet, that would make work for mother. I&#8217;m
glad I forgot that hat, though. That&#8217;ll have to
be dry, anyway, now; and maybe after all, when
Bonny-Gay gets well she may want it herself.
It was her mother gave it to me, not her. Now
which way&mdash;I guess this. Oh! I know! I&#8217;ll
find that gardener, Mr. Weems, and he&#8217;s so
nice and kind he&#8217;ll show me the way to go.
Maybe, after all, there is another car goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
nearer to Dingy street than that one I took first
and&mdash;There&#8217;s a man. It might be him. I&#8217;ll
run and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when she had clicked across the path to
where the man stood he had already begun to
move away, and she saw that he was not at all
like the gardener. So she paused, irresolute,
trying to recall by which of the several avenues
leading from it she had entered the Place.</p>

<p>There were people hurrying homeward in
each direction, and a few smart equipages were
whirling past; but nobody paused to glance at
her, save with that half-shudder of repugnance
to which she was quite accustomed when she
met strangers, and that had rarely wounded her
feelings as it did just then and there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help that. And I don&#8217;t mind
it for myself, not now at all, since I know
about poor father. He&#8217;s the one feels worst for
it. And that I shall tell him the very minute
I see him. So let them look and turn away, if
they wish. Looks don&#8217;t hurt, really, and oh!
dear! if I only could remember the street I
ought to take. Charles, of course. I know that
and there it is; but whether to go to that side or
this&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>In the midst of her perplexity the electric current
was turned on and the Place was suddenly
and noiselessly flooded with a light as of day.
Courage came back and after another hasty
scrutiny of the streets, to discover some landmark
that she could recall, she saw the monument
and the lion, and ran toward them as if
they had been old friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny-Gay loves them, and so does the
Gray Gentleman, and they do look as quiet and
peaceful as can be. I stopped there, I know,
and maybe I&#8217;ll think it out better there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet even in that reposeful place Mary Jane
could gain no new ideas as to her course,
nor was anybody near to whom she could apply.</p>

<p>The gardener had long since gone home for
the night, and in desperation, Mary Jane determined
to appeal to the very first person who
came by. This proved to be a young man, with
a cane and eyeglasses; and he appeared to be
extremely busy. The little girl thought he
must also be one of the &#8220;aristocratics&#8221; of
whom her father spoke so contemptuously, because
when she had asked him to &#8220;please tell
me the way to Dingy street?&#8221; he had scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
glanced at her but had haughtily replied:
&#8220;Never heard of such a place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. Too bad. Father says they don&#8217;t
any of them know very much, and I&#8217;m sorry.
Don&#8217;t know where Dingy street is, indeed!
when I know it myself, even a little girl like
me and have lived there always. I mean ever
since I was a baby and we left the country.
That, mother says, was the mistake we made.
In the country father didn&#8217;t drink and lose his
work. Well, we&#8217;ll go again, some day, when I
get big and strong, and can help more with the
wash. We could earn a lot, mother and me
together, if I was big.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lost herself in her day dreams for a little
and awoke from them with a start, to find the
twilight altered to real night, while the electric
gleams from the lamps overhead were brighter
than ever and their shadows more like ink upon
the pavement. Mary Jane had never seen such
brilliancy as this, and again she forgot herself
in studying her surroundings and enjoying the
vivid green of the grass and shrubs.</p>

<p>A certain clump of flowers, glowing in the
radiance, attracted her especially and she felt
that she must put her face down on them, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
smell them, before she lost sight of them forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;For I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll ever come this way
again. I couldn&#8217;t expect it. Mother couldn&#8217;t
spare the money even if she could me and&mdash;even
if I ever get back to her again!&#8221; she concluded,
with a frightened sigh. But the beautiful
blossoms enticed her, and in her own down
town park, which had been thrown open to
whoever of the poor would enjoy them, there
were few &#8220;Keep off&#8221; signs and the few quite
disregarded. This she had explained to Bonny-Gay;
and what was true of one park in the city
should be true of all.</p>

<p>So she hopped nimbly over the velvet lawn
to where the flowers gleamed scarlet and white
and wonderful, and bending above them thrust
her face deep down into their loveliness. Oh!
how sweet they were! and so crisp and almost
caressing in their touch upon her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear flowers! I wouldn&#8217;t hurt you, you
know that, don&#8217;t you! I wouldn&#8217;t break a single
one of you, no, not for anything. Seems
like you&#8217;d feel it if your stems were broken,
poor things. But I&#8217;ll not harm you. No, indeedy.
Only I wish&mdash;I wish I could just take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
one tiny, tiny piece home to mother. But I
wouldn&#8217;t break you, even for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you&#8217;d better not! What are
you doing here? How dare you come on this
grass? Can&#8217;t you read the signs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane looked up, and was immediately
terrified. It was a policeman who held her
arm, and all the wild stories she had heard of
arrests and imprisonment flashed into her mind.</p>

<p>In Dingy street there was, also, a policeman;
but a friendly soul whom all the children loved,
and whose own home was close to theirs. It
was he who had saved many a baby&#8217;s life, from
careless passing vehicles, when busy mothers
had not the time to watch them as they should;
and his blue uniform represented to Mary
Jane&#8217;s mind an all-powerful guardian, to whom
appeal was never made in vain.</p>

<p>But this six-foot officer, with his glitter and
dignity, his harsh voice and vise-like clutch&mdash;this
was the majesty of law outraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what have I done! I didn&#8217;t mean it&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; gasped the frightened child, and
wrenching herself loose swung away upon her
crutches, faster even than the officer could have
pursued her, even if he had been so minded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>He did not even attempt to follow her, but
watched her flight, with a chuckle of amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scared her well, that time, the little vagrant.
Well, it&#8217;s right a lesson was given &#8217;em.
If every child who wanted to smell the bushes
was let, what would our parks look like!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like bits of Paradise, as they should;&#8221;
answered a voice behind him, so suddenly that
the policeman wheeled about to find himself
face to face with a resident of the Place himself.</p>

<p>As for Mary Jane she neither saw whither
she fled nor scarcely breathed before she had
collided with a swiftly advancing figure, and
found both herself and it thrown down. Captured
after all! Her eyes closed with a snap,
as there seemed to rise before them the vision
of a station house, filled with frowning policemen,
and herself in the midst, a helpless
prisoner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>ON THE WAY HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Well,</span> upon my word!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane opened her eyes. Then she rubbed
them to see more clearly. Indeed, she rubbed
them twice before she made out her mistake
and was able to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I am so sorry! I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;but
I can&#8217;t be arrested! I can&#8217;t&mdash;my mother&mdash;I&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>She scrambled up somehow, picked her
crutches from the ground and set off again.
She dared not look behind her but was quite
sure that the hard-faced policeman was in full
pursuit. Off she was, indeed, only to be
brought to a sudden stop, while a shiver of
fear ran through her. But she made no further
outcry and rested quietly upon her wooden
feet, to hear her doom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you poor little girl! You look
scared. You haven&#8217;t done any harm, not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
bit. In fact, you&#8217;ve saved me quite a chase.
I&#8217;m not so swift as you are, hard as I tried
to catch you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane shivered and still said nothing,
nor could she lift her eyes from the ground.
Their gaze rested idly upon the man&#8217;s feet and
she fancied that the gloss upon his shoes
equalled the radiance of the electric light.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now that I have caught you, I want
to thank you, with all my heart, for your kindness
to my precious child. I believe the good
Lord sent you, just in the nick of time, with
your ready answer and your readier sympathy.
Yet to think that, after all this, you should run
away, at night and alone. You poor, brave
little child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she heard, through her puzzled understanding,
another voice speaking in jesting surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn your back on an old friend, would
you, Miss Bump! Well, we will have to see
about that, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Those were tones to banish fear! and now, in
truth, Mary Jane&#8217;s eyes were raised and she
saw standing there and smiling down upon her
none other than the Gray Gentleman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>The revulsion of feeling was too much for
her self-control, and dropping her face against
his hand she began to cry, with all the abandon
of those who seldom weep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, little girl! What is it? Were you
so badly frightened as all that? There, there.
You&#8217;re with friends now, child, who love you
and will take care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that she felt herself lifted in the Gray
Gentleman&#8217;s arms, and her head forced gently
down upon his shoulder, while her crutches fell
noisily to the stones. However, they were
promptly picked up again by the other gentleman,
who was also gray&mdash;as to hair and beard&mdash;and
who made almost as much noise as the
crutches, because he kept blowing his nose so
vigorously. Then she heard him softly slap
her own Gray Gentleman&#8217;s free shoulder and
exclaim, in a husky voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, neighbor! The Lord has
been good to us. Bonny-Gay is almost herself
again and was laughing&mdash;actually laughing&mdash;to
see me, her dignified daddy, run out
of her room to try a race with Miss Mary
Jane here. Oh! it&#8217;s too good to be true!&#8221;
and again there was a tremendous flourish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
of handkerchief, and a sound like a small fog
horn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; murmured the Gray Gentleman,
and Mary Jane felt him tremble. Instinctively
she raised her head to comfort him
and touched his thin cheek timidly with her
lips.</p>

<p>But there was no timidity in the kiss he returned
her as he set her upon the ground, and
with all his usual cheerfulness, demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, little traveler, how do you propose
to get home again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; The tone was a happy
one and seemed to mean: &#8220;And I don&#8217;t care!
You are to find the way for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t, eh? But I&#8217;m thinking that
good mother of yours will be hungry for a
sight of your face, and it&#8217;s time we remembered
her. Mothers are queer bodies. They like to
have their youngsters around them, be they
never so bothersome. Yet, since she&#8217;s waited
so long, I think it will do no harm for her to
wait a while longer. I&#8217;d like to have you pay
me a little visit, as well as Bonny-Gay, and
I&#8217;ll invite you to my house to take supper with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
a lonely old fellow who&#8217;ll entertain you as well
as he can.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard to refuse, she would so much
have liked to see the home of her friend, of the
friend of all the children whom she knew. But
the vision of her mother, waiting and anxious,
was too much for her loyal heart, so she declined
as prettily as she knew how, only requesting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, please, you are to tell me the quickest
way home to Dingy street and I&#8217;ll go. You
must know it, for you&#8217;ve been there so often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it, and I&#8217;ll take you at once.
I&#8217;ll do more. I&#8217;ll invite myself to supper with
you after I get there, since you can&#8217;t stop with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Mary Jane, though not
with much enthusiasm. She was afraid he
would think her mother&#8217;s supper a poor one.
However, he was quite welcome to what they
had, and she added more cordially: &#8220;I know
mother&#8217;d think it an honor, only I&#8217;d have to
stop at the baker&#8217;s on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t quite understand why both gentlemen
laughed so heartily. They now seemed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
a mood, each one of them, to laugh at any and
everything which happened, and Bonny-Gay&#8217;s
father teased the other a little about his great
appetite, which required the contents of a bake-shop
to satisfy. Then he added, with a manner
that admitted of no denial:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll have to defer your visit, neighbor,
till another time. I claim the privilege of
conveying this young lady to her destination,
and my man has already summoned a cab.
Here it comes, now; for I&#8217;d rather trust a city
cabby to find out odd places than my own
coachman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here came the cab, indeed, and from the
vine-clad mansion on the corner also came a
liveried servant bearing a big basket tightly
covered.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the mistress&#8217; compliments, and Miss
Bonny-Gay is sending this to the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221; answered the happy
father, and took Mary Jane from the Gray
Gentleman&#8217;s arms; who handed her crutches in
after her, and himself closed the door of the
cab with a cheerful snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some other time, then, Mary Jane, I&#8217;ll expect
a visit from you. My regards to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
mother and I will be down your way before
long. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s head whirled with the strangeness
of it all. What a day it had been! And
how simple and kind was this gray-haired
father, who didn&#8217;t look half so strong as her
own absent one, but who talked so fast and
asked so many questions that, before she at all
realized what she was doing, the cripple had
given him their whole family history. Save
and excepting, of course, anything which related
to her own affliction and its cause, or any
possible fault of her beloved father.</p>

<p>&#8220;He works&mdash;I mean, he did work&mdash;for the
B. &amp; B. railroad folks. He&mdash;he&mdash;isn&#8217;t working
just now. He went away, for a little while,
but I guess he&#8217;s back again. Won&#8217;t he be surprised
to hear all that&#8217;s happened to me? He&#8217;ll
be glad, after all, that she didn&#8217;t&mdash;Oh! my
sake! what am I saying!&#8221;</p>

<p>At mention of the Company, the gentleman
beside her had given a little start of surprise,
but Mary Jane fancied that the jolting of the
cab had moved him. She expressed her regret
for the accident and added:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I like it. I never rode in a carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
but once before. That was yesterday when
Bonny-Gay was hurt. But she&#8217;ll soon be well,
now, I think. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I trust. So I trust and believe. But,
tell me a little further of your father. What
sort of work did he do? I happen to know
something about that company and am interested
in the details of all its concerns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes he was helping along the
tracks; straightening them, changing the ties,
and such things. Sometimes he was over at
the great sheds they&#8217;re building&mdash;monstrous
ones, they are, almost all of steel. You ought
just to see them by daylight. Though I guess
I can show them to you even to-night, &#8217;cause
they&#8217;re not so very far from our house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! Did you say what street it was?
I heard my neighbor give some directions to
the driver for us, but paid little attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dingy street, number 97.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dingy street! You don&#8217;t say! Why, I
know that locality well. Very well, indeed. A
great many of&mdash;of the Company&#8217;s employees
live around there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most all of them do, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;So your father&#8217;s out of work, just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But he&#8217;ll soon be &#8216;on&#8217; again, I think.
When he does work he gets real good wages.
That is, if he isn&#8217;t &#8216;docked.&#8217; I reckon the Company
is pretty strict. My mother says they
don&#8217;t allow for anything. A man must do his
task or leave it, and that&#8217;s the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is quite right and just, is it
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;suppose&mdash;it is. Though poor men can&#8217;t
always&mdash;I mean, they get discouraged sometimes.
That makes them do and say things
they wouldn&#8217;t else. It&#8217;s queer and unjust, my
father says, for the Company to have so much
money and their men so little. That&#8217;s what
made him glad&mdash;I mean not so sorry&mdash;when&mdash;when&mdash;things
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane paused, confused. Twice she had
nearly told this other father that her own father
had been glad when Bonny-Gay had been hurt.
She knew William Bump would not have said
anything so cruel if he had not been drinking;
she was sure of that, for he was generally so
kind of heart. But even yet she did not imagine
that her companion was himself the president<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and head of that Company whose wages
her father gladly accepted even when he talked
against it most fiercely.</p>

<p>However, Mr. McClure greatly enjoyed listening
to this frank story of the underworkings
of his vast enterprises. He was not only
a very wealthy and powerful man, he was also
a wise and just one. He felt the responsibilities
of his position, and made it his business
to know all employees by name and character,
so far as that was possible. Over this particular
portion of his affairs, right in his own city,
he had an almost daily supervision, and he
knew William Bump, in some respects, much
better than this loyal little daughter did. His
opinion of the father was very poor, and he had
himself given orders, on the previous day, that
the said William was never again to be taken
on by his managers, &#8220;not in any capacity whatsoever.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some distance the gentleman made no
response to Mary Jane&#8217;s last remark, and the
silence was broken only by the roll of their own
wheels, the ordinary sounds of the streets
through which they passed, and the increasing
rumble of the thunder. The storm was drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
nearer and he wished to escape it, if possible.
He signalled the driver, after a while,
and seeming to rouse himself from some deep
thought, to: &#8220;Make haste!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cabman lashed his horses into a gallop,
and remembering the accident of her one other
ride, Mary Jane began to grow afraid. She
was afraid now, also, of this silent gentleman
beside her and longed for her journey to end.
To pass the time she tried to count the lamps
on the street corners as they flew past her in
the gloom, and to watch for the illuminating
flashes of lightning, which came faster and
faster.</p>

<p>Suddenly, into this silence, Mr. McClure
hurled a stern question, that compelled a truthful
reply, whether she liked to give it or no.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Jane, of what was your father glad
when that accident occurred?&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught her breath in alarm; then answered,
frankly:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was glad because&mdash;because Bonny-Gay
was hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t know. I mean&mdash;I guess he
was so sorry about me&mdash;being like I am&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
he thought it wasn&#8217;t fair. She was as beautiful
and perfect as I was&mdash;was ugly; and her
father had all the money and he had none. But
it wasn&#8217;t right and it wasn&#8217;t him. Indeed, indeed,
it wasn&#8217;t. He didn&#8217;t know you, of course,
and he didn&#8217;t dream that you could love her
same as he loves me. But he&#8217;d be the first&mdash;the
very first&mdash;to be sorry, after he came to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. No man, rich or poor, has a right
ever to be other than himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not. But things haven&#8217;t gone
right with father since we came from the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; was the contemptuous comment,
and the little girl said no more.</p>

<p>Oh! if they would only ever get to 97 Dingy
street! Twice, now, she had been allowed the
luxury of a carriage ride and each time how
wretched she had been. At first she had liked
Bonny-Gay&#8217;s father almost as much as she had
the Gray Gentleman, when she first knew that
good friend. She had chattered away to him
almost as freely; yet after awhile he had allowed
her to keep up the chatter rather for his
own information than because he had seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
interested in her affairs. He was now become
so stern and indifferent that she realized she
had deeply offended him. To her relief, the
cab turned sharply around the next corner and
there she was, at last, in dear, familiar Dingy
street, with its tiny houses that were yet homes;
in one of which was mother Bump, her four
sisters, and the wonderful baby! Possibly,
also, her father; though of him she thought
less, just then, than of the motherly face
which was, to her, the comeliest in all the
world.</p>

<p>The cab stopped with a jerk. The cabman
leaped down and opened the door. Then he
lifted out the covered basket, and afterward
swung Mary Jane to the ground and supported
her till the gentleman who remained inside the
vehicle handed out her crutches.</p>

<p>The house door flew open, also, at the sound
of wheels, and Mrs. Bump peered out into the
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she called, her voice trembling
with anxiety. That a carriage should stop
before her humble home foreboded harm to
some of her loved ones, and her first thought
was of her crippled daughter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;Here am I, Mother! Home at last;&#8221; answered
that daughter&#8217;s voice, cheerily.</p>

<p>Then she turned to thank Mr. McClure for
his kindness to her, but he did not hear her,
apparently. The cab was already being whirled
around, and the driver lashing his horses. A
brilliant gleam of lightning, followed instantly
by a terrific clap of thunder, startled them into
a thought of shelter only. Mrs. Bump saw
through the cab window that the gentleman
raised his hat, then she seized the basket from
the ground, and hurried Mary Jane indoors,
just as the first great drops of a heavy shower
came dashing down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! mother Bump! I never saw such a
lovely place as this dear old home! How glad
I am to be here. Has father come yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, dearie. But he will soon, no
doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he isn&#8217;t anywhere out in this storm;
poor father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, child! The man has sense,
hasn&#8217;t he? Even dumb creatures know enough
to go in when it rains. But tell me fast, darling,
all that&#8217;s happened to you since you went
away. My heart! this has been the longest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
day I ever knew! have you had anything to eat?
What made you so late? How came you to be
riding home in such grand style? and where
got you this basket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the baby&#8217;s, mother. Bonny-Gay sent
it to him;&#8221; cried the happy girl, running to
seize that crowing infant from his trundle-bed
and to cover his face with kisses. Then she
dropped her crutches and herself upon the floor,
drew the baby to her lap, and from that lowly
position began a swift, but rather mixed history
of events since she had said good-by and
hopped away in the morning.</p>

<p>The mother listened, losing never a word,
and deftly simplifying matters now and then by
a leading question, while at the same time she
explored the big basket. It had evidently been
filled in haste, and by the direction of Bonny-Gay,
herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is for the <i>baby</i>, is it?&#8221; laughingly
demanded Mrs. Bump, lifting out a great loaf
of rich cake, carefully wrapped in waxed paper.
&#8220;Fine food for a year-old, that is. And this?
and this? My heart, but whoever filled this
basket had a generous streak!&#8221;</p>

<p>A fine roasted chicken, mate to that of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Mary Jane had already partaken, it might be,
followed the cake. Then came a picture-book,
a jumble of toys, a box of candy, and an odd
mixture of the things nearest at hand, and of
which the sick child could think.</p>

<p>But crowning all these gifts, and the only
one packed with any attempt at care, was the
beautiful leghorn hat, with its nodding ostrich
plumes and its general air of elegance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The darling, the darling! She did mean
me to keep it, then!&#8221; cried Mary Jane, so delightedly
that the baby immediately pat-a-caked
with noisy vigor.</p>

<p>Of course, even though they had long since
enjoyed their ordinary supper, the watchful
children were not to be put off without at least
a taste of the baby&#8217;s good things; so the mother
cut and divided with exact equality; and after
a feast so hilarious that it brought Joe Stebbins
in from next door to see what was the matter,
everybody was sent to bed; even the tired Mary
Jane, whose heart seemed brim full of both joy
and anxiety.</p>

<p>She had explained to her mother how she
had chattered to Mr. McClure, hiding nothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
even her unwise statement of William Bump&#8217;s
animosity toward the other, happier father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bump had listened quietly, and she had
pooh-poohed the little girl&#8217;s regrets! but her
heart sank. Mr. McClure was the name of the
head of the Company. She knew that, though
Mary Jane did not; and she realized that her
husband&#8217;s last chance of reinstatement in the
Company&#8217;s employ had been ruined by the very
one who would have sacrificed her very self to
do him good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little daughter! But she must never
know. Never. It would break her loving
heart! And it matters little now whether William
comes home or not!&#8221; sighed the troubled
wife and mother, as she laid her own weary
head on her pillow for the night.</p>

<small>CONFIDENCES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Oh!</span> I am so tired! If I could only just
get up once!&#8221; sighed Bonny-Gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick folks always have to stay in bed.
How&#8217;d they look, sitting up, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;
answered Mary Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not sick. I&#8217;m not sick one bit.
I&#8217;m just as well as&mdash;as that parrot, yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth!&#8221;
shrieked Polly.</p>

<p>Mary Jane laid down the thirteenth doll and
clapped her hands to her sides. &#8220;That bird is
the absurdest thing. He makes me laugh till
I ache.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a story, that&#8217;s a story!&#8221; corrected
Poll.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t! No, it isn&#8217;t! No, it isn&#8217;t!&#8221;
mocked Mary Jane, gaily.</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay laughed, too, and cried out:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;Mary Jane, you&#8217;re the very nicest girl I
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. That&#8217;s a dear thing for you
to say. But you&#8217;re partial, like mother. Besides,
there isn&#8217;t any other girl here, just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I mean it. There isn&#8217;t another girl in
the world would come here and be shut up in
the house, day after day, just to amuse me,
&#8217;cause my leg&#8217;s broken, except you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is,&#8221; said Mary Jane, confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you funny child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you? If you and I were each
other&mdash;I mean changed places and I was the
sick one, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. I don&#8217;t know. I never did like
indoors and would never stay in if I could help
it. Do you s&#8217;pose it will be very long now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I guess not. Not if you&#8217;re good and
lie still. Wait. I&#8217;ll bring all the playthings
around to that other side the bed and that
will rest you. You&#8217;ve been looking out this
way a good while now.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Mary Jane industriously hopped around
and transported the thirteen dolls, the bird<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
cages, and the parrot stand to a new position,
and leaning on her crutches gently helped the
sick child to turn about as far as she was permitted
to do. A trained nurse was still always
in the room, and Mrs. McClure herself passed
in and out very frequently; but it was Mary
Jane who did most for her friend; Bonny-Gay
declaring that, &#8220;Next to Mamma&#8221; there was
nobody who understood her whims and desires
without being told them, as the little cripple
did.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because we&#8217;re just an age, I guess.
Queer, wasn&#8217;t it? That you, up in this big
house, and me down in my dear little one,
should both be sent to our folks the very same
day that ever was? &#8216;Sunday bairns&#8217; should
be the best ones in the world, my mother says.
Only, I wasn&#8217;t in my Dingy street house when
I came. I was in the country;&#8221; and for some
unexplained reason Mary Jane&#8217;s sunny face
clouded suddenly.</p>

<p>For weeks now, and because Bonny-Gay had
&#8220;taken such an extreme fancy to her&#8221;&mdash;as
Mrs. McClure had herself explained to Mrs.
Bump, when she herself went to ask the favor
of Mary Jane&#8217;s attendance in the sick room&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
helpful child had spent the greater portion
of each day there. It had become quite a matter
of habit in Dingy street that a carriage
should roll up to the door of 97 and that Mary
Jane should go away in it; to be returned at
six o&#8217;clock precisely, of the same afternoon.
Dingy street felt itself proud of this state of
things, and every householder held her head
a bit higher because of it. Who&#8217;d ever have
dreamed that their own small hunchback would
get to be &#8220;carriage folks?&#8221; Well, there was
no telling when such glory might not fall to
their own lot, and she&#8217;d do them all credit
wherever she went, she had such pretty, loving
ways with her. That she had.</p>

<p>Now, it was sometimes an inconvenience to
the McClure household that this trip must be
made twice a day; and that very morning Mrs.
McClure entered the chamber to speak with
Mary Jane about it. She had now overcome
her first repugnance at sight of the deformed
little body and saw only the sweet face and
helpfulness. She had, also, offered Mrs. Bump
some compensation for her daughter&#8217;s &#8220;services;
just the same as any other nurse&#8217;s;&#8221; but
the poorer mother gently declined.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;If the dear Lord has given her a chance to
do something for your girl, whom she so loves,
I guess He means it as a sort of compensation
to her for her own afflictions. No, indeed, Mrs.
McClure, I wouldn&#8217;t like to taint the sympathy
between those two by any thought of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this there could be no answer, and so the
matter rested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Jane, we begin to feel almost as if
you belonged with us, you have been so kind
and good to Bonny-Gay; and what do you say
to staying up here at night, now? At least for
a few nights together, with then one at home?&#8221;
asked the lady, as she sat down beside the cot
and watched the undressing of the china seventh
doll, preparatory to its bath.</p>

<p>Mary Jane looked up quickly, with a sort of
fear coming into her telltale face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I shouldn&#8217;t like that. I mean&mdash;of
course, you&#8217;re very kind&mdash;but I&#8217;d have to go
home. I would, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not kindness on my part, especially.
I thought it might save trouble to both sides;
but, never mind. We&#8217;ll go on as usual, for the
present; though I wish you would speak to
your mother about it, when you see her, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
evening. Now, Bonny-Gay, I have to go out.
Is there anything you fancy, that I can bring
you? I shall be at market and do some shopping.
Think and see, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay&#8217;s eyes had rested searchingly
upon Mary Jane&#8217;s face. She would have been
delighted herself if her playmate could have
remained all the time in the Place, but she saw
the sudden fear and was puzzled by it. Yet
she did not urge the matter, and the only request
she made of her indulgent mother was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just bring something new for the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Mary Jane&#8217;s face was troubled and
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Bonny-Gay don&#8217;t! He has too
many things already, that you have sent him.
I&#8217;d rather not, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Mrs. McClure, as she
kissed her little girl and went away. But she
was considerably annoyed. She felt that she
did not exactly &#8220;know how to deal with that
class of people,&#8221; to which Mary Jane belonged.
She wished that Bonny-Gay had not taken this
absurd fancy of hers. She wished that the
Gray Gentleman had never done that unwise
thing of carrying her daughter into the region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and knowledge of Dingy street. It was all
very well for him to devote his time still, as
he had all his life and fortune, toward making
the lives of poor children brighter. Everybody
must have a hobby, and that was his, she supposed.
Of course, he was a noble man, and
his name was known far and wide as that of a
philanthropist. Still&mdash;Hmm. It would soon
end, anyway. Bonny-Gay was improving rapidly,
and was so perfectly healthy that there
was nothing to fear. And if she needed her
own carriage that evening, and Mary Jane remained
still obstinate, she must be sent home
in a cab. That was all.</p>

<p>With these thoughts she departed, but she
had in some way left an altered atmosphere behind
her. Her difficulty in understanding &#8220;that
class of people&#8221; arose from the simple fact
that she had, as yet, no real sympathy with
them. It seemed to her that they were altogether
different from herself; that they were
duller, less capable of any true nobility. But
she was, in reality, kind and good at heart, with
many social cares to tax her nerves, and she
was one day to have her present ignorance enlightened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>In the silence that followed her exit, Bonny-Gay&#8217;s
hand stole softly out and touched Mary
Jane&#8217;s cheek, down which a tear was rolling.
And in the child&#8217;s touch was that perfect sympathy
which the mother&#8217;s tone had lacked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Mary Jane. He&#8217;ll come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s head lifted instantly and her
face brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you know &#8217;twas that I was thinking
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I knew. After a minute. Not just
at first. Mother didn&#8217;t understand. I don&#8217;t
s&#8217;pose she&#8217;s heard yet that he was gone. Move
up nearer. Fix yourself comf&#8217;table. Let&#8217;s
talk, instead of play dolls, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane pushed her low chair to the
side of the cot, so close now that she could
rest her head against Bonny-Gay&#8217;s own pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth!&#8221;
admonished Polly, and in their laughter at his
opportune command they failed to hear that
somebody had entered the room and sat down
quite near them. This was Bonny-Gay&#8217;s father,
and he liked sometimes to surprise her by an unexpected
visit of this sort, as well as to listen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to the innocent chatter of this pair of &#8220;Sunday
bairns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long is it, Mary Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the very day you were hurt. Two
whole weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well. That&#8217;s all right. Max is with him,
isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He went away with him.
They both felt bad, I guess. That made them
like to be together. Father&#8217;s powerful fond of
dogs, any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And of the country, you said, too. I s&#8217;pose
he&#8217;s in the country somewheres.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where! I do want to see him so much.
There is something I must tell him. Something
he thinks is wrong, something that made
him feel bad but should not. Something&mdash;Oh!
I&#8217;ve seen all through things so clear, since he
went. Every time he saw me I s&#8217;pose he was
reminded that&mdash;My sake! What am I saying.
But I&#8217;m so sorry about your mother not liking
to send for me. I must have bothered her no
end. I wouldn&#8217;t have come only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have come? Why, it was I
who wanted you, who must have you. Don&#8217;t
you know, you are my &#8216;twin sister?&#8217; It&#8217;s all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
right. Mother would give me anything to have
me pleased. Don&#8217;t think a thing about that.
Let&#8217;s talk about the rest. Say, Mary Jane,
say!&#8221; Excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are. Off you go! Have a
care!&#8221; warned Polly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! keep still, you bird. Listen, Mary
Jane. You know I&#8217;m going to the country,
don&#8217;t you? We all are, just as soon as I get
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I think it will be just lovely for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For you, too, you go with me and&mdash;find
him!&#8221; almost shouted Bonny-Gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you darling! Might I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. Why shouldn&#8217;t you? My father
owns a lot of country. Ever and ever so much.
He has so much he says it&#8217;s a sin and shame it
isn&#8217;t doing anybody any good. But he&#8217;s too
busy to tend to it himself and he can&#8217;t trust
many folks. They would waste his money,
dreadful. There&#8217;s our big house and park, and
all the gardens and things; and then there are
fields and fields and fields. Miles of them, I
guess. Just as like as not he&#8217;s gone around
there some place. Just supposing! If he has,
why, pooh! You could find him in a minute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Oh! you must go with me and look. It won&#8217;t
be so long, maybe. If this old leg would only
get itself well. I love the country. It&#8217;s all out-doors
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane said nothing, but her face was
rapturous with anticipation. Finally, Bonny-Gay
announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s all settled, then. There&#8217;s
nothing to do about it only ask our folks.
Let&#8217;s make believe things. Let&#8217;s pretend we
had all the money in the world and could
do just what we wanted to with it; what
would you do, first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I wouldn&#8217;t dare think. &#8217;Cause it
couldn&#8217;t ever come true, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing it couldn&#8217;t? The things that
don&#8217;t come true are the sweetest things there
are, I think. You begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane drew a deep breath. Under the
inspiration of this other more imaginative child,
she was fast forgetting the hard, dry facts of
life; and whether this were best or no, it was,
at least, delightful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d go to your father and I&#8217;d pay him
money, and I&#8217;d get all those miles and miles of
country to do with exactly as I pleased. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
I&#8217;d take some more of the money and I&#8217;d get
the men that build houses to make a house,
right in the very prettiest spot there ever was.
Where there was water if I could, &#8217;cause my
father, he&#8217;s so fond of fishing. He&#8217;s quit work,
lots of times, to go fishing down the bay. I&#8217;d
buy him a fish-pole and lines and hooks. I&#8217;d
buy him and mother a cow and a horse and a
market-wagon. They had a market-wagon
once, but a man came along and told him he
could make more money in the city; and he sold
their things and lost the little farm and came.
He&#8217;d be all right if he was back in that country,
I guess. I&#8217;d like to see it, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eager speaker stopped short. Again she
had almost revealed what no loyal daughter
should,&mdash;a parent&#8217;s fault. But Bonny-Gay was
so interested, she seemed so to know beforehand
what was in a body&#8217;s mind that words
slipped out of themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care. Tell the truth!&#8221; adjured
Polly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will,&#8221; answered the cripple.
&#8220;Now, Bonny-Gay, it&#8217;s your turn. What
would you do if you had all the money and
could?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>The unseen father leaned forward a little.
He was profoundly interested in any possible
desires his darling might express, and, for the
matter of that, she rarely did ask for anything.
Maybe, because almost all desirable things came
to her without the asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know. Yes, I do, too. I&#8217;d buy
all the parks in this city and in every other one.
I&#8217;d hunt up all the little children in the cities.
I&#8217;d make free &#8216;Playgrounds&#8217; for them, every
one. Even the little girls should have their
little cunning &#8216;farms,&#8217; just the same. I guess
they&#8217;d want to plant flowers, though, wouldn&#8217;t
they? instead of cabbages and limas. Then I&#8217;d
take all the grown-ups who wanted to go into
the country and couldn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;d send them.
And I&#8217;d let them stay a whole week, I guess.
If I could. If there was room enough. And
when Christmas came I&#8217;d have everybody that
was poor come to my house, just like the Gray
Gentleman does to the halls he hires, and I&#8217;d
make them as happy as&mdash;I am. I wouldn&#8217;t let
anybody in the whole wide world be sick nor
sorry; I wouldn&#8217;t let anybody hurt nice dogs
or turn them out of their own parks; and&mdash;Oh!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Mary Jane, do you s&#8217;pose we&#8217;ll ever see dear
old Max again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bonny-Gay? Didn&#8217;t you just make
me feel &#8217;t he was right with father? Course,
then, when father comes he&#8217;ll come; and if you
aren&#8217;t well by that time I&#8217;ll coax father to lead
him up here to see you. If he&#8217;ll be coaxed;&#8221;
she added gravely.</p>

<p>The child on the cot glanced through the
window. &#8220;There goes the Gray Gentleman, to
see &#8216;Father George&#8217; and the lion. I wish he&#8217;d
come to see me; but he&#8217;s afraid my mother
blames him for taking me that day, I think,
though nobody ever said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go ask him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could be stopped, Mary Jane
hopped across the room and down to the door.
Mr. McClure rose with considerable noise and
approached the cot. He had been deeply
touched by the fact that neither of the two innocently
dreaming &#8220;Sunday bairns&#8221; had planned
anything for her own especial gratification.
The witness of such unselfishness was refreshing
in a world such as that wherein most of his
waking hours were passed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Well, little woman, how goes it? Getting
well, fast?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay held up her arms to be loved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, father dear. It won&#8217;t be long before
I&#8217;m out in the park again, watching for
you to come home from business.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found so much to say to each other
that they quite forgot Mary Jane; who had, indeed,
swung across the square to intercept the
path of her friend. She had something of her
own to say to the Gray Gentleman besides delivering
her playmate&#8217;s message. She was in
trouble and knew that he would help her in
some way too wise for her to think of.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, upon my word! If here isn&#8217;t Mary
Jane! I thought I heard a cheerful little
clicke-e-ty-click, such as only one small energetic
body could make. What&#8217;s it now, Miss
Bump?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to talk to you, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t doubt I need it. Yet if the &#8216;talking
to&#8217; is to be very severe, I&#8217;d like to have the support
of the lion. Let&#8217;s rest against him. That&#8217;s
comfortable. Now, my child&mdash;talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First off, Bonny-Gay wants you to come
and see her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;Shall be delighted, I&#8217;m sure. Please make
my regards to Miss McClure and I will wait
upon her at any hour she designates.&#8221; Which
dignified yet whimsical remark set Mary Jane to
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that&#8217;s fixed before I forgot. Because
I&#8217;m in dreadful trouble, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look it!&#8221; he exclaimed, smiling into
her confiding face; then dropped his playful
manner as he saw that she was really in earnest.</p>

<p>Whereupon she promptly told him about
Mrs. McClure and why, in anticipation of her
father&#8217;s possible return, she must, she must go
home every night. &#8220;And how can I? I mustn&#8217;t
put them out&mdash;they are so good to me. I
mustn&#8217;t stay away, if Bonny-Gay needs me.
There&#8217;s all the dolls to be dressed, you see; and
the canaries must be fed, or they&#8217;d die; and
Polly is about as much care as the baby. She&#8217;s
always dropping things and squawking till she
gets them picked up for her&mdash;though she throws
them right straight down again. I don&#8217;t see
how Bonny-Gay can be so patient with that
bird, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shouldn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, I couldn&#8217;t not come, course. And what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
I want you to tell me, please, is there a shorter
way I could come? So I could walk here?
&#8217;Cause I couldn&#8217;t ride in the car. We couldn&#8217;t
afford that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would ride in the car I know, without
asking, that Mrs. McClure would be more
than glad to bear the expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But father wouldn&#8217;t like that. He never
likes me to have rich folks do things for me.
He&mdash;he seems to about hate them. He
wouldn&#8217;t let me go to the Empty Stocking
Trees, &#8217;cause he does. You&#8217;re the only one he
doesn&#8217;t mind. And he likes the &#8216;Playgrounds&#8217;
&#8217;cause they&#8217;re not charity. They belong to the
city and we do, same&#8217;s the rich ones. They
teach the children to work and learn farming,
too. He likes that. But I couldn&#8217;t take the
money from her. I wouldn&#8217;t so displease him,
even if I had to stay away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman pondered deeply. He
would not offend the confiding child by offering
himself to pay her car fare. He too greatly
respected her honest pride and her loyalty to
her father to do that. But, after a moment, he
looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mary Jane Bump, once before I invited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
you to call at my house and you declined.
Now, I invite you again. I think I have something
there that will solve your difficulties&mdash;and
my own. May I have the pleasure? I&#8217;ll
detain you from the Poll parrot but a few moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;d love it!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a very cheerful click the crutches gave
now. The mere telling of her perplexities had
half-banished them, and Mary Jane had implicit
faith in the wisdom of this simple, true-hearted
gentleman, who was, as Mrs. McClure had reflected,
&#8220;the friend of all poor children everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gray Gentleman&#8217;s big, empty, plainly
furnished house, seemed very lonely to the little
girl, whose own small home was so crowded;
and she wondered at the slowness of the one
colored &#8220;boy&#8221;&mdash;as gray as his master&mdash;who
answered that master&#8217;s ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy, go up-stairs, please, to my bedroom.
Open the top drawer of the chiffonier and bring
me all the socks you find there. You&#8217;d better
use a basket&mdash;they are many in number.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Boy&#8221; half fancied that his master had
lost his common sense, then leaped to the conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
that this was probably one of their many
pensioners upon whom the articles demanded
were to be bestowed. He obeyed without comment,
however, save by a respectful bow; and
soon returned. Meanwhile Mary Jane had
been shown the few pictures upon the walls and
told their stories, and the place had begun to
seem more cheerful to her.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Boy&#8221; was dismissed; the basket
heaped with fine hosiery placed on the table
beside the visitor, and herself bidden to look
the contents over.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of them, Mary Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew one person have so many
stockings; and, my sake, there isn&#8217;t a single
pair but has a hole in it&mdash;not one single sock,
even. I know. I guess you want me to mend
them for you, don&#8217;t you? I often help mother
with the darning. She thinks I can do it quite
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can, and that is just what I
do want. I cannot put on a ragged garment,
poor old fellow though I am. They always
come from the laundry, broken somewhere,
and I am always buying new. That&#8217;s how I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
have so many. If you want to save my money
for me you can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to! I&#8217;ll take them home and fix
them nights, after Bonny-Gay is through with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be business like, Miss Bump. What
would be your charges, per pair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My&mdash;charges? Nothing. I&#8217;d be so <i>glad</i>
to do something for you, who have always been
doing things for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known you a few weeks, little girl,
and I&#8217;ve done very little. Will five cents a pair
be satisfactory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t take so much. I couldn&#8217;t take
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That or nothing. I&#8217;m business. That
would make you quite independent of all help
except your own, and be a great benefit to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, then. And oh! thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, pack up your work, little bread-winner,
and let&#8217;s back to Bonny-Gay.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>BY THE STRENGTH OF LOVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days sped by. The summer heat deepened
and there were thankful hearts in the vine-covered
mansion in Mt. Vernon Place. For
Bonny-Gay was well again; able to run about
her beloved park, and to play in the shadow
of the lion with the few children left still in
that part of the city.</p>

<p>Nearly all the big houses were now closed,
however, and their owners departed to seashore
or mountain. The McClures themselves were
making preparations for their own summer
flitting to the great country house of which the
little girls had talked. They would have still
enjoyed being together, but that could no
longer be.</p>

<p>A very few days after Mary Jane had made
her business contract with the Gray Gentleman,
and he had himself spoken to the conductors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the cars upon which she would have to take
her daily ride&mdash;so that everything was
made easy and safe for her&mdash;those rides had
ceased. William Bump returned as suddenly
as he had departed, and, with all his old enmity
against more fortunate folk, had immediately
forbidden them.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bump had herself gone to Mrs.
McClure and explained enough of matters to
prove that Mary Jane was neither ungrateful
nor forgetful; and Mrs. McClure had accepted
the explanation with great cheerfulness. It was
a much easier way out of a difficult position
than she had anticipated; because Bonny-Gay
still talked about inviting Mary Jane with
them to the country, and this her mother did
not at all desire.</p>

<p>However, a compromise was effected. Mary
Jane was to be asked to care for the thirteen
dolls, the two canaries, the aquarium, and
Polly; only the pony being allowed to accompany
his little mistress on her summer outing.
So, one morning, the carriage came around
again and all these creatures were stowed in
it, along with Bonny-Gay and a maid. They
had been taken straight to Dingy street, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
they were left with many injunctions and much
sage advice, as to their proper care. Then the
two little &#8220;Sunday bairns&#8221; had kissed each
other many times, and had torn themselves
weeping from each other&#8217;s embrace, while the
dignified maid looked coldly on, urging:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, Miss McClure, you would
much better be going. The train goes at two
o&#8217;clock and there&#8217;s much to pack, still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Hawkins. I&#8217;m coming. Good-bye,
Mary Jane, dear, dear Mary Jane! I&#8217;ll
write you as soon as I get there and maybe,
maybe, your father and my mother will let
you come out to our house and make me a beautiful
long visit. I&#8217;d teach you to ride on the
pony just the same as if your legs were good,
or in the goat cart or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, Miss Bonny-Gay!&#8221; called
Hawkins.</p>

<p>The coachman cracked his whip, there was a
last glimpse of a bare sunny head thrust from
the carriage window, the tossing of ecstatic
kisses, and Bonny-Gay had passed out of Mary
Jane&#8217;s life, probably forever. That is, if the
intentions of her parents could be carried out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
When they returned, in the autumn, a man
could be dispatched for the dolls and things, if
their owner still desired them. If not, they
might remain the property of the small Bumps,
and so well rid of them. The parrot had been
misbehaving of late, and using expressions not
wholly suited to the proprieties of Mt. Vernon
Place. Originally owned and trained by a man
of the &#8220;slums,&#8221; she was returning to the rude
speech of earlier years.</p>

<p>But she was well received in the Bump household,
save by William, its head. He had
frowned upon the coming into it of Bonny-Gay&#8217;s
treasures and only consented to the arrangement
because of Mary Jane&#8217;s disappointment.
For ever since his return the father and
daughter had been always together and each
seemed doubly anxious to do nothing that
would give the other pain. And after a time,
even he became interested in the queer bird and
joined his children in inciting it to talk; though
his interest was not fully won until there
sounded along the street a familiar cry, to
which nobody paid much heed except Polly.</p>

<p>She was suddenly transformed. She fluttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
her feathers, stretched her neck, cocked
her head on one side, and in a tone that was
almost human in its mimicry burst forth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Crab-crab-crab-crab&mdash;crab-crab-crab! Devil-devilled-devil-devilled-crabs!
Heah&#8217;s-de-crab-man! Is yo&#8217; hongry? Crab-man-goin&#8217;-to-baid-now!
Dis yo&#8217; las&#8217; chance for yo&#8217; nice-fried-hot-fried-devil-devilled-crabs!
C-R-A-B-S!
OU-OU-OUCH!&#8221;</p>

<p>After which remarkable exploit mistress
Polly became the idol of Dingy street and even
of William Bump.</p>

<p>The disposition of her new charges, so that
they should not take up too much space in her
little home, and the careful packing away in the
top-cupboard of the food Bonny-Gay had provided
for her pets, kept Mary Jane busy all
morning; and her mother had dinner on the
table before she observed how the time had
flown. But when she heard the cheerful summons:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, father. Come children!&#8221; and
smelled the freshly cooked fish, she realized
that she had given more attention than she
meant to her new cares.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! mother, I didn&#8217;t think I was so long!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
And I wanted to get my part of the ironing done;
because I promised Bonny-Gay that I&#8217;d go to
the park, if you could spare me, and watch her
train go by. It&#8217;s that fast express, that whizzes
so; but she&#8217;s to sit on the park side the parlor
car, she called it, and she&#8217;s to watch for me and
I for her. She&#8217;ll wave and I&#8217;ll wave and that
will be our really last good-by. Till she comes
home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be how-de-do? Wouldn&#8217;t it,
child? And the ironing&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ve done
that so, if father wants to go watch the men
this afternoon, you can go with him. Now eat
your dinner and be thankful for all your blessings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody was always hungry at that table
and the dinner was soon over. Then William
Bump arose, put on his hat, whistled to a big
black dog who lay on the doorstep and started
off for his afternoon of loafing.</p>

<p>Mary Jane watched the pair with a pitying
love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those two seem just alike, some ways,
don&#8217;t they mother? Father lost his home and
his work and so did Max. Dearly as Bonny-Gay
loves that dog, ever since he got her hurt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
he doesn&#8217;t want to be with her like he used.
Didn&#8217;t you notice, this morning? When she
hugged him and bade him good-by, he was
just a little pleased; yet he kept one eye on
father and soon&#8217;s he could walked back and
lay down beside him. Father is dreadful good
to Max, isn&#8217;t he? He often says he&#8217;d never
have come back if it hadn&#8217;t been for&mdash;for us&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For you, daughter. Mostly for you, it
was, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Max helped. He staid right close
and coaxing like. Oh! I do wish the Company
would give father another try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m in hopes, after awhile,
he&#8217;ll find something else to do. Meanwhile
you stay close to him. Don&#8217;t give him a chance
to get down-hearted again and&mdash;you know.
Didn&#8217;t you say your Gray Gentleman was coming
to the park to look at the &#8216;farms&#8217; this
very day? Why, maybe, child, maybe he&#8217;d
know of a job somewhere. You might ask
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I might. I will. What&#8217;s father going
to do now? he&#8217;s taken to the track.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says that, though he has no work there,
there isn&#8217;t any law forbids him sitting round,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
watching his old friends who have. He likes
to talk with men, you know; and if you&#8217;re
handy by he&#8217;s quite satisfied. Father doesn&#8217;t
like to go wrong any better than we like to
have him. He trusts you to watch out for him,
honey. So, if I were you, instead of taking
the baby and going along the street to the
gate I&#8217;d go to the park by the railroad.
You can climb up the embankment at an
easy place, and stay near father. Then you&#8217;d
be able to see everything. The children in
the &#8216;Playgrounds,&#8217; and the Gray Gentleman
if he goes to them, and Bonny-Gay&#8217;s train
when it comes, and all. Only&mdash;only, Mary
Jane&mdash;take care to give the cars plenty of
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course I will. &#8216;Look out for the cars
when the bell rings!&#8217;&#8221; laughingly quoted the
child. &#8220;And you look out for the parrot when
the crab-man comes! I guess you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;d
better not take the baby. If I climb up the bank
I might let him slip. Good-by. I&#8217;ll make
father all right and happy, don&#8217;t you fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother watched her darling out of sight,
thinking how sunshiny and helpful she was,
then settled the baby safely among his new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
playthings and resumed her endless toil. But
she was wholly happy and contented now. They
were poor, indeed, but they were not suffering,
and her hopeful heart was sure that in some
way a task would be found for her husband
which would keep him out of idleness and
evil company. She began her one hymn of
cheerfulness: &#8220;Lord, in the morning Thou
shalt, Thou shalt, Lord, in the morning Thou
shalt hear, my voice ascending high.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mary Jane had hopped along the
road till she came to a part of the railway embankment
which she could climb, then scrambled
to its top. Just before her the rails were laid
over a long trestle above the deep bed of a
stream, now almost dry. A little water still
ran among the stones below but Mary Jane
did not look down upon that. She made her
way swiftly, yet cautiously, beside the track,
pushed rapidly along the trestle, and reached her
father&#8217;s side, at the further end of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here am I, father. I&#8217;m going to watch
for the train from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A fellow workman looked up and remonstrated:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to let that girl walk that
trestle, Bump. If her crutches slipped it&mdash;the
bottom&#8217;s rough and deep down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m not afraid. I don&#8217;t often, either,
though I&#8217;ve played about this railroad ever
since I was born. All the Dingy street children
play there. How pretty the park looks, down
yonder;&#8221; interrupted Mary Jane, anxious that
her father should not be blamed, especially for
what was not his doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. You oughtn&#8217;t, daughter,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t again, then, father, if you don&#8217;t
like. But I was safe enough. What&#8217;s that
team for, that&#8217;s coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to haul off that pile of ties
that have been taken up. Company gives &#8217;em for
the hauling. Only things it ever does give, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to work faster. See. They
keep dropping them on the track. If a train
should come by it would get thrown off. Don&#8217;t
they know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they know it all right, but they&#8217;ll be
in time. They&#8217;re used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in this very hardihood of custom that
the danger lay. A beginner at such a task<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
would have watched constantly for the approach
of a train, but this &#8220;gang&#8221; did not. For the
greater ease of handling they rolled the heap
of heavy ties over upon the track, as the anxious
girl had observed, and two men lifting leisurely
placed the weighty, worn out timber upon the
wagon. The mule team before the wagon stood
half-over the edge of the embankment, heads
dropped, themselves enjoying the rest regardless
of position.</p>

<p>The men laughed and talked. William Bump
joined in the chatter and forgot Mary Jane.
The talk grew more interesting, to the speakers,
and became a torture to the listening girl,
though she paid no attention to the words. She
realized, merely, that they were growing more
and more indolent; the pile of ties upon the
rails lessened very, very slowly. It was already
long past noon, she knew that. She was
familiar enough with the running of trains to
know, also, that the through express was the
next one due. It was upon this through express
that Bonny-Gay would travel. She began
to feel cold with her anxiety. She must
speak to those men, even if it should displease
her father, who hated interference of that sort.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>So she moved forward a little way and
touched the arm of the foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me the time, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten minutes to two, little girl. Pretty hot
up here, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he answered, good naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Jane, don&#8217;t meddle. Children should
be seen not heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father. Only ten minutes! Why,
you&#8217;ve been ever and ever so long taking off less
than half the ties. Can you finish in ten minutes?
Can you?&#8221; she demanded, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, kid, what&#8217;s the hurry? Got another
job for us, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hurry? The train. The two o&#8217;clock
express. It&#8217;s almost due.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman&#8217;s face paled a trifle. Then he
whistled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew, sis, you&#8217;re right! Jim, lead that
team off the bank. We&#8217;ll just roll the rest
down to the bottom and drive round there to
load up. Now, with a will! there ain&#8217;t no time
to spare! here she goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mules were led away by one man while
the others exerted themselves to clear the tracks
in any and every manner possible. There was
no longer any talking. There were no false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
movements. They knew that there was no way
of signalling the express, just there, even if
there should be need. But there must be no
need, the tracks must be cleared. Must be!</p>

<p>William Bump moved down upon the bank
and watching from an apparently safe place
called upon Mary Jane to follow him.</p>

<p>She did not hear him. She stood, resting
upon her crutches, anxiously watching the toilers,
straining forward, as if in that attitude she
could help them, and listening&mdash;listening&mdash;with
every nerve at tension. She did not see the
Gray Gentleman, who had come into the park
awhile before and having caught sight of his
favorite&#8217;s pink frock, crossed the level space
from the &#8220;Playgrounds&#8221; to the embankment to
see what so interested her. As he reached the
spot below the end of the trestle he, also, began
to comprehend what was passing in Mary Jane&#8217;s
mind and his own cheek whitened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! It&#8217;s coming&mdash;it&#8217;s coming!&#8221; cried
the girl. &#8220;Work&mdash;work!&#8221;</p>

<p>They did work with a will. There was no
need for anybody to urge them. They, also,
heard the low rumble of wheels along the distant
track, the shiver and tremble of the rails.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
The heavy ties rolled down&mdash;fast and faster.
The way was almost clear. There was only one
tie left and that&mdash;</p>

<p>A man turned to look over his shoulder.
&#8220;The train! The train! It&#8217;s on us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole gang leaped to safety and waited.
The one big timber still lay crosswise above the
trestle. It meant destruction. They knew it,
Mary Jane knew it. They could not move; but
she could. That menacing log should not destroy!</p>

<p>Ah! but those long, strong, useful arms of
hers stood her in good stead just then. All the
strength of her body was in them. The
crutches went, she knew not where. She was
lying flat, forcing, pushing, compelling that
last tie down, over the edge. The train was almost
there. She knew that, also, but she felt no
fear. She must do her task&mdash;she must&mdash;she
could!</p>

<p>The men on the bank watched breathless, but
not one went to her aid. Even William Bump
seemed stricken to stone.</p>

<p>There came a crash. The log was over&mdash;the
track was clear!</p>

<p>But where was Mary Jane?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>As he rounded the curve just before the
trestle the engineer had seen the child upon the
track, but though he instantly reversed his engine
the train could not be brought to a stand-still
till it had quite crossed the openwork space,
and he stepped down from it with horror in his
heart.</p>

<p>A horror which quickly changed to a shout of
joy, though the peril was yet not over.</p>

<p>Again these long, strong arms had done their
owner good service. As the train came upon
the trestle she slipped down and dropped between
the ties, clinging to one for her life. She
scarcely heard now that rumble and roar above
her; all her consciousness was fixed in the clutch
of her fingers upon that cross-beam.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the Gray Gentleman who first reached
the spot and prostrating himself upon the roadbed
reached down to clasp her arms and draw
her up to safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;You precious child! You heroine!&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened her eyes at that, gave him one
radiant smile, and promptly fainted away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Which, she afterward declared, was a very foolish
thing for a sensible girl to do.</p>

<p>She as promptly revived, however, and there
was Bonny-Gay hugging and thanking her, but
not saying good-by, at all! And there was
Mrs. McClure, that proud and dignified lady,
snatching the crooked little figure from the
Gray Gentleman&#8217;s arms, to enfold it in her own
and to weep and cry over it in the most astonishing
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you darling, darling child! You&#8217;ve
saved our lives, saved Bonny-Gay, who&#8217;s more
than life to us. Little did I guess how noble
you are. Nobler, Mary Jane, than anybody I
ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was like a dream. The people, all the
passengers and trainmen, crowding round to
thank and bless the little hunchback, who now
rested in her own father&#8217;s arms, while he
beamed upon her, proud and happy, but with
soul-cleansing tears streaming down his softened
face. And there was Mr. McClure, laying
his hand kindly upon William Bump&#8217;s
shoulder and begging:</p>

<p>&#8220;For any injustice I&#8217;ve done you, for any
injustice you&#8217;ve done me, let this hour make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
amends. As man to man&mdash;trust me, William
Bump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, Boss. I will, I will and the poor
man looked into the face of the rich man and
behold! it was as that of a brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this to-do?&#8221; cried Mrs. Stebbins,
to Mrs. Bump. &#8220;The express has stopped
and there&#8217;s a crowd of people coming this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I just heard the
train go by. I hope nothing&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not wrong, sure. The men are tossing
their hats and cheering and the women&mdash;they&#8217;re
laughing and talking like they&#8217;d struck a gold
mine. They&#8217;re headed this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bump was too busy to look. She
had a lot of clear-starching to do and she was
engaged in a new, therefore interesting, task;
she was teaching Polly to sing a hymn!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you smart bird. If you can talk crab-man&#8217;s
talk, that always sounds sort of wicked,
though, of course, it isn&#8217;t, you can learn better
things just as easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I can, so I can. Tell the truth, tell the
truth, tell the truth,&#8221; answered Polly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m telling it, never fear. Learn it
you shall. Now begin&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>But the lesson was interrupted. The voices
of the crowd were near at hand; were at the
door; were in the very room! What did it
mean? William was placing Mary Jane in her
mother&#8217;s arms, as if she had been the baby himself&mdash;helpful
Mary Jane! And Mrs. McClure
was clasping Mrs. Bump&#8217;s neck, and sobbing
and laughing on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Everybody was talking at once, but suddenly
somebody cleared a space and placed a chair
behind the startled mistress of the house. She
sank into it gratefully, her knees now trembling
too much to support her. But the facts had
penetrated to her consciousness, at last, and with
a cry that hushed all speech of others, she held
her precious &#8220;Sunday bairn&#8221; to her heart with
a thankfulness beyond words.</p>

<p>Suddenly, upon this sacred silence, there fell
a voice which seemed neither bird nor human,
yet strangely reverent and opportune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Lord, in the morning Thou shalt, Thou shalt,</div>
<div class="verse">Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear</div>
<div class="verse">My voice ascending high.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>At this interruption there were some who
wept&mdash;but none who smiled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CONCLUSION<br />


<small>AFTERWARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course there was an afterward. There
always is.</p>

<p>The fallow fields of the McClure estate no
longer lie idle under the blue sky, a reproach
to their owner. The property was not quite of
the &#8220;miles and miles&#8221; in extent which Bonny-Gay
had imagined, but it was still sufficient
to set apart a goodly number of acres as a
home for Mary Jane, who had never known
how beautiful the country was until she was
driven one day, along a smooth road, under
over-hanging trees, and over bridges crossing
here and there the prettiest trout stream in the
world. The drive was interrupted, &#8220;to let the
horses rest,&#8221; where there was a fine view of a
cottage, freshly painted in cream and white,
and with the most inviting of piazzas extending
from its sides.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Mary Jane had been allowed to make a little
visit at the home of Bonny-Gay, and had been
absent from Dingy street for one whole week.
This day her absence was to end, even with this
day; and she thought it a little odd that Bonny-Gay
should seem so extravagantly happy,
as if she were glad that the visit were over.
Though, of course, the guest knew better than
that. There was not the slightest doubt in the
heart of either &#8220;Sunday bairn&#8221; concerning
their mutual love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what a pretty house! We haven&#8217;t
come this way before, have we? Is it on the
road to the station, Bonny-Gay? How happy
the folks must be who live there. But I&#8217;m
happy, too. Dingy street will seem perfectly
lovely to me when I get there. Do you suppose
the baby has grown much? I wonder if
Polly has learned any new things. Mother&#8217;s
a master hand to teach, mother is. She taught
me my letters while she was working round.
She thinks I can, maybe, be spared to go to
school&mdash;sometime. How I want to see her.
Seems as if I could hardly wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m so glad, so glad!&#8221; laughed Bonny-Gay,
and even the old coachman&#8217;s face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
beamed with smiles, though in ordinary he felt
that it was his business, when on duty, to conduct
himself like an automaton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll write to me, won&#8217;t you?
You promised, that other time, before you
started, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I shall do no such thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny-Gay!&#8221; There was a volume of reproach
in the tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Not a line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose house is this, do you suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t &#8216;suppose&#8217; when I know things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Beulah Standish McClure! What
would your mother say? If there&#8217;s anything
she wants you to be it&#8217;s a lady. So I&#8217;ve heard
her say, time and again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I. I&#8217;m tired of hearing it. I mean,
I&#8217;m trying to be one. She wouldn&#8217;t care. She&#8217;d
do it herself, if she were here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never! She never, never would be so rude.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay made a funny little grimace, then
leaned sidewise and hugged her friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do the Dingy street folks know better how
to behave than the Place folks, missy?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;Yes, Bonny-Gay, I think they do&#8221;; answered
Mary Jane with dignity. For she had
now been associated with the McClure household
long enough to get a fair idea of the proprieties;
and she was sure that driving up to
the doors of strange houses and inquiring their
owners&#8217; names, was not one. However, she
could do nothing further, for it was Bonny-Gay&#8217;s
carriage and not hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive in, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the phaeton turned into the pretty driveway,
bordered with shrubs, and around the lawn
by a freshly prepared curve to the very front
door itself. Mary Jane had turned her head
away and utterly refused to look. She was
amazed at Bonny-Gay, her hitherto model, but
she&#8217;d be a party to no such impertinence; not
she.</p>

<p>Then her head was suddenly seized by her
mate&#8217;s hands and her face forced about toward
that unknown doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Mary Jane Bump! You shall look!
You shall. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll break my heart.
Look quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s lids flew open. Then she nearly
tumbled off the seat. The Gray Gentleman was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
coming down the steps, smiling and holding out
his hand. Smiling and calling, too:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve come, Mrs. Bump! They&#8217;ve
come!&#8221; Mary Jane, in her newly acquired
ideas of etiquette, wondered to hear such a
quiet person speak so loudly or jest upon such
themes. She had instantly decided that this
was some friend&#8217;s country house, where he,
too, was visiting. Odd that his hostess&#8217; name
should be like her own.</p>

<p>But all her primness vanished when out from
that charming cottage flew a woman with a
baby in her arms. A woman in a print gown,
clear-starched as only one laundress could do
it, and a baby so big and round and rosy he had
to be spelled with a capital letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! My mother and the Baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome home, my child! Welcome
home!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Baby cooed and gurgled something
that sounded very like &#8220;Ome,&#8221; without an
H.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has everybody gone crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite!&#8221; answered William Bump, appearing
from another corner. He was as
washed and starched as his wife, and had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
for himself even something more, in honor of
this great occasion&mdash;he was smoothly shaved.
He looked years younger than his child had
ever seen him and oh! how much happier and
more self-respectful. He had found his right
place again. He was once more a tiller of the
soil; and there is nothing so conducive to true
manliness as finding one&#8217;s congenial task and
feeling the ability to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s head buzzed with the strangeness
and wonder and delight of it all. Yet the
explanation was very simple and sensible.</p>

<p>It was impossible but that the McClures
should do something to evince their gratitude to
the little saver of their child&#8217;s and their own
lives and they did that which they knew would
be most acceptable to her; they gave her this
home in the country.</p>

<p>For the house, with its deed was made to
Mary Jane Bump, herself; but over the wide
fields surrounding it her father was made overseer
and farmer, for his old &#8220;Boss,&#8221; at good
but not extravagant wages. The house had
long stood empty, ever since the railroad magnate
had dropped his former scheme of agriculture
on a big scale, but it was in good repair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and quite large enough to accommodate even
the household of Bump. A coat of paint made
it like new and during the cripple&#8217;s absence from
Dingy street the flitting was accomplished.</p>

<p>Bonny-Gay&#8217;s own summer home was near
at hand, though she had driven Mary Jane to
the cottage by such a roundabout way; and her
delight had lain in her knowledge of the happiness
that was coming to her friend.</p>

<p>This was a year ago. As yet no cloud has
marred the perfect sunshine of Mary Jane&#8217;s new
life. She now rides to school in a smart little
cart, drawn by the sedatest of piebald ponies.
She is apt and ambitious and is learning fast.
Indeed, she is confidently looking forward to a
day in the future when, being both old and wise
enough, she shall be matriculated at a certain
famous woman&#8217;s college; to don the cap and
gown whose ample folds shall hide, at last, her
physical deformity. God speed you, Mary
Jane! and all your happy sisterhood!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
